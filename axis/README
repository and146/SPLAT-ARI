This is an extracted part of Axis 1.2.1  

The docs and webapps directories contain the unmodified, imported, equivalent
directories from the binary release. See the "do_import" script for the
commands used to do this.

The "axis.war" file in the lib directory is just a jar of the contents of the
webapps/axis directory, minus the "lib" directory, with a
"WEB-INF/server-config.wsdd" file added.

The src/lib directory is a copy of axis/lib, but with the following changes:

  - a copy of axis.war has been placed in the axis.jar file in the same
  directory as the AxisEngine class. This means that the war file maybe
  located: 

    URL warFile = AxisEngine.class.getResource( "axis.war" );

  - the log4j jar files have been removed. This should mean that the Java 1.4 
    logging system is used, which is more compatible with our system.

Miscelleaneous directories.

  webapps/lib is copy of webapps/axis/WEB_INF/lib, this is probably no longer
  required.
