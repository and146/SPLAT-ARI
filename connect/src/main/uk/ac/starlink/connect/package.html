Classes related to persistent connections to remote services.
Currently the main service provided by the connections defined here is
access to some kind of filesystem which is modelled as a simple
tree structure (see {@link uk.ac.starlink.connect.Node} and subinterfaces).

<p>Connection implementations are supplied by classes in other
packages; the {@link uk.ac.starlink.connect.ConnectorManager}
class is the place to find out what implementations are available in
this JVM.
