Classes for hierarchical browsing of directory and data structures.
<p>
Using the classes available in this package, hierarchical data 
structures can be viewed interactively.
The GUI side is based on a Swing <code>JTree</code> component,
and the underlying data model is supplied by classes conforming
to the package's <code>DataNode</code> interface.
<p>
Adding knowledge of a new type of hierarchical data is done by
providing a new class implementating <code>DataNode</code>.
Such new <code>DataNode</code> implementors must be able to do the
following:
<ul>
<li>supply their children on request (though not necessarily know 
    what type of node each child represents) - this should be done
    by using a <code>DataNodeFactory</code>
<li>provide a textual and iconic representation of itself
<li>possible provide a <code>JComponent</code> giving fuller details
    of itself
<li>have one or more constructors based on fairly generic objects such
    as <code>String</code>, <code>File</code>, other types of 
    <code>DataNode</code>
</ul>
The <code>DataNodeFactory</code> class should then be informed of
the existence of the new class.
