<H2>Changes between 0.1 and 0.2</H2>
<P>Since 0.1 was the &quot;hard-hat&quot; release, we felt OK about making lots of changes which we haven't documented.
From the next release onwards, the degree of stability in each package and class is clearly indicated using the
&quot;red-yellow-green-blue&quot; rating system.
