	<P>The canvas demo shows off the basic architecture and feature of the canvas. At the top level of the window,
	the canvas contains an instance of GraphicsPane contains several figures.

	<OL>
	<LI>Click with button 1 to select figures (the two large figures are different -- see below.
	<LI>Shift-click with button 1 to toggle figures into and out of the selection.
	<LI>Selected figures have a set of grab-handles placed on them. Click and drag on a grab-handle with button 1 to
	reshape the figure.
	<LI>Drag out a region of the canvas with button 1 to select multiple figures. Shift-drag to toggle items covered
	by the drag-rectangle.
	<LI>Click on the background to clear the selection.
	</OL>

	<P>The six sliders to the right of the window control the transform of the top-level canvas pane. They can be used
	to control the scale, rotation, translation (two sliders), and shear (two sliders) of the top-level pane with respect
	to the containing canvas. Note that all of the figure selection and editing operations work in the presence of
	arbitrary transforms.</P>
	<P>The two larger figures are nested canvas panes. Each of them has a background, and contains a complex canvas
	pane of their own. Thus, visualization and editing components can be arbitrarily nested to any depth. (In a later
	release, we will provide level-of-detail and control to make this more useful.) In the example, the magenta &quot;swatch&quot;
	pane contains figures that can be selected but not reshaped, while the &quot;cloud&quot; blue pane contains the
	same graph editor pane shown in the graph example. (Nodes can be added and connected with edges.)</P>

	<P>By default, mousing inside one of these embedded processes acts on the internals of the pane. To move and reshape
	the pane as a unit, first select it by drag-selecting on the top-level background, then drag it to move it or drag
	a grab-handle to reshape it.
