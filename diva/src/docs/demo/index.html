			<H3>The diva.graph demo</H3>
			<P><BR>
			The graph demo demonstrates basic graph editing and layout functionality, illustrates the key points of the graph
			architecture. A graph is constructed programmatically, and can then be edited interactively by the user. There
			are two views of the graph: one which has an automatic layout algorithm applied each time a new node is added,
			and one which uses a random or user-driven layout.<BR>
			<BR>
			The interaction and display in the graph editor, although currently fairly simple, uses the features of the Diva
			canvas to good effect. The use of two views of the graph highlights the Swing-style model-view-controller architecture
			of the graph package.<BR>

			<H3>The diva.canvas demo</H3>
			<P><BR>
			The canvas demo illustrates the main architectural features of the canvas. The window contains a single instance
			of JCanvas, containing an instance of GraphicsPane. The six sliders control the scale, rotation, translation, and
			shear of the top-level pane.<BR>
			<BR>
			The pane contains a number of figures that can be selected and manipulated. Note the use of translucent fills and
			arbitrary clip-regions supported by Java2D. The Diva canvas is a relatively light-weight layer over Java2D, so
			any rendering that can be done in Java2D can also be done in canvas figures.<BR>
			<BR>
			Two of the figures recursively contain panes -- one is another GraphicsPane, and the other is a graph editor. The
			graph editor can be manipulated in the same manner is described for the graph demo above. We plan to use this hierarchical
			structuring facility to explore display and navigation through complex information spaces.<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>Note:</B> The demo is currently very sluggish due to problems in Java2D's hit-testing code. A bug report has
			been filed, and this problem will hopefully be fixed in the next maintenance release. Also note that this problem
			is most noticeable with examples that use GeneralPath; please see the canvas tutorials for some examples that do
			not have this problem.<BR>

			<H3>The diva.sketch demo</H3>
			<P><BR>
			The sketch demo demonstrates a sketch-based editor that is built using the diva.sketch package. This is a simple
			editor that allows free-hand drawing. The editing window contains an instance of JSketch which by default sets
			up all the necessary classes to handle sketch input. JSketch uses Diva canvas package that implements scaling and
			dragging of figures. <BR>

			<H3>The diva.whiteboard demo</H3>
			<P><BR>
			The whiteboard demo is a digital whiteboard which supports multiple documents and pages, saving and loading sketches,
			changing pen colors and widths, and other basic whiteboard capabilities. In addition, it supports basic editing
			commands such as selection and deletion using pen gestures.<BR>

			<H3>The diva.whiteboard.uml demo</H3>
			<P><BR>
			The UML editor is a digital whiteboard application with an embedded sketch interpreter that understands a subset
			of the notations of UML class diagrams. It provides basic electronic whiteboard features, gesture command editing,
			and recognition of classes and relations in UML static structure diagrams.<BR>

			<H3>The diva.sketch.trainer application</H3>
			<P><BR>
			Sketch trainer is a program that allows users to create customized gestures for their application. Users enter
			about 15-20 samples for each type of gesture (e.g. square, triangle, circle, etc.) and can save the training samples
			to a file. The user can also load in a previously created training file and modify its contents graphically.</P>

			<P>After the samples are created, the user can test the recognition by pressing on the <I>Train</I> button. This
			will launch a sketching window in which gestures are recognized if they are similar to the training data. If a
			gesture is recognized, its type will be shown next to its figure. <BR>
