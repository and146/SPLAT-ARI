<P>The sketch demo is meant to be a simple demo that illustrates how to construct a sketch-based user interface
quickly using the Diva sketch package.  Therefore it doesn't provide any gesture recognition.  It is a simple sketch-based
editor that supports free-hand drawing and allows users to save and load their sketches.</P>

<P>One can sketch in the window where the drawing is recorded as a set of pen strokes.  A stroke is a collection
of points taken from pen down to pen up.  One can select a stroke by control-clicking anywhere on the stroke. 
When selected, the stroke can be scaled through the blue handles and can be moved by dragging the red handle in
the center.</P>

<P>Save and load can be accessed from the file menu.  The sketch is saved in XML format and has file extension,
&quot;.sk&quot;.</P>
