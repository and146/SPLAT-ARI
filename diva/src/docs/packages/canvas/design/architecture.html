<h1>JCanvas architecture</h1>

<!--/contents-->

<p>
The Diva canvas has a highly structured internal architecture.  At
the top level of the architecture is an instance of JCanvas, which is
a Swing component, and thus embeddable in any Swing user interface.
Below that is a tree of graphical components, with the key
roles defined by the interfaces in this figure:

<p>
The interface that defines the role of every node in the graphical
component tree is CanvasComponent. This interface defines methods
that traverse the tree upwards. getParent() always returns
the immediate parent of the node. getTransformContext() returns
the enclosing transform context (see the section on transform contexts).
The two repaint methods propagate repaint requests up the tree to
the JCanvas and ultimately to the Swing repaint manager (see the section
on damage regions).

<p>
The interface that extends CanvasComponent with the notion
of visibility and paintability is VisibleComponent. It has
setVisible() and isVisible() methods, so that display can be
turned on and off. The paint() method must be implemented
to paint the whole component, while the paint(Rectangle2D)
method must paint at least within the given rectangle. This
can be used by components to optimize their painting.

<p>
The remaining interfaces are explained in more detail on following
pages. Here is a diagram illustrating (somewhat inaccurately) how
these interfaces are implemented in the key components provided by the
canvas (the blue classes are those shown on the figure above):

<p>
All of these classes are explained in detail on following pages, but
here is an overview.  The JCanvas contains a single
CanvasPane. Concrete subclasses of CanvasPane contain a stack of
CanvasLayers. One in particular, FigureLayer, contains a set of
Figures.

<p>
Below this level, two forms of structural recursion take place.  The
first form of recursion is figure containment. The
AbstractFigureContainer class is a Figure that contains other figures,
and so any concrete subclass is an aggregation of Figures (which may
in turn be FigureContainers).

<p>
The second form of recursion is pane containment. An instance of
PaneWrapper contains a CanvasPane, thus providing a recursive link back
to near the top of the canvas architecture. This approach allows a
visualization or editing component to be written for a pane, and then
easily embedded into any other pane.
