<h1>Key interfaces</h1>




The Diva canvas includes several interfaces that define roles
played by classes that are spread over the class hierarchy.
These roles are collected and explained here, and will only
be referenced on later diagrams. Here, the key extending interfaces
or implemented classes are also shown on the diagram.

<p>
The UserObjectContainer is an interface that defines the
<b>userObject</b> property. This interface is implemented by any class
that has the notion of a corresponding semantic object. In the Diva canvas,
only Figure uses it.

<p> A VisibleComponent is an object that may be painted on the screen.
It has one property, <b>visible</b>, and two versions of the paint()
method, one which will paint the whole component, and one which will
paint it only within the specified bounding box. It is extended by
Figure and by some of the canvas layers.

<p> An EventAcceptor is an object that is prepared to handle layer
events. It has an <b>enabled</b> field, which determines whether it
accepts events, and a single processLayerEvent() method.  It is
implemented by CanvasPane and a number of canvas layers.
