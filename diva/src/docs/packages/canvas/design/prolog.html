The diagrams in this document are mostly UML static structure
diagrams. These class diagrams are at the conceptual design level
rather than the detailed design level. I have adopted a couple of
conventions to make the diagrams clearer.

<ol>

<li> Attributes that are marked as public are not in fact public, but
are treated as <i>properties</i> in the JavaBeans sense. For example,
the public field <b>shape:Shape</b> means that the class contains a
<i>private</i> variable with this name, and the methods
<b>setShape(Shape)</b> and <b>Shape getShape()</b>. In Diva, almost
all instance variables are private; if they are not, it is noted in
the text.

<li> Not all operations in a class have the return type given, and
significantly more do not have the argument names and types given.
This is to elide unnecessary clutter in the diagrams.

<li> Abstract classes may only show the abstract methods in that class.
This will be shown by the method named "..." at the end of the method
list, meaning that all other methods that are in an implemented
interface are implemented in the abstract class. Sometimes, overridden
methods will also be shown to flag different behavior.

<li> A class that does not have its attributes and operations
shown is either in another package, or is documented on a
different page.
 
</ol>
