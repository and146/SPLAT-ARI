<h1>Structural recursion</h1>





There are two sources of structural recursion in the Diva canvas.
These are outlined here, although full details of the classes involved
are given only in the sections relevant to those classes.

<p> The first form of recursion is figure containment. Any class that
implements both Figure and FigureContainer is a figure that contains
other figures. In the Diva canvas, AbstractFigureContainer is the root
of these classes.

<p> The second form of recursion is pane containment. An instance of
PaneWrapper contains a CanvasPane, thus providing a recursive link
back to near the top of the canvas architecture. This approach allows a
visualization or editing component to be written for a pane, and then
easily embedded into any other pane, together with an appropriate
scaling transform and background fill. (This is the
recommended approach to designing an editing or visualization
component: create an application-specific CanvasPane, not an
application-specific JCanvas.)

<p>
Various nodes in this tree define a new coordinate system.
This is described on the next page.
