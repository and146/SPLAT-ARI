<h1>Interaction roles</h1>





[Incomplete]

 <p>

Each figure may have associated with it an <i>interaction role</i>.
The interaction role answers the question "What does this figure do
when I mouse on it?" Typically, a 2D application will have a large
number of figures, which can be subdivided into distinct subsets
according to their interactive behavior. A simple graph editor, for
example, has two such sets: nodes, and edges. To give these
figures the correct behavior, each will have a reference to
the "node role" or the "edge role," as appropriate.

<p>
In order to allow roles to have arbitrary properties
that can be set and accessed by clients, InteractionRole
implements PropertyContainer, which essentially defines
a simple hashtable-like interface.

<p>
When a figure is clicked-on, its interaction role adds it
to a selection model. [FIXME]
