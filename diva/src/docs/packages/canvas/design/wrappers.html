A <i>wrapper</i> is a class that has a single child. Wrappers serve
a special purpose in the Diva canvas: wrappers are not proper figures,
but act as Decorators (in the sense of Gamma et al) for other figures.
Typically, wrappers affect that way in which the figure it wraps
is rendered.

<p> The diagram shows the place of wrappers together with some of the
subclasses implemented in the Diva canvas.  Any figure can be
<i>wrapped</i> by calling the wrap() method of its parent. This method
must be implemented by containers to place the figure in the wrapper
and insert the wrapper in the tree in its place. Once this has been
done, the wrapper will receive all paint() calls before the wrapped
figure, allowing it to draw additional elements on the screen
or make other modifications that affect how the figure appears
on the screen.

<p> In general, a wrapper may also wrap another wrapper.  To allow
consistent access to the figures (as opposed to the wrappers) that
make up the image, the wrapper class has methods to access the
following related objects:

<ul>
<li>The <i>parent</i> is the immediate parent;
<li>The <i>container</i> is the first ancestor that is not a wrapper;
<li>The <i>child</i> is the child single child of this wrapper;
<li>The <i>wrappedFigure</i> is the first descendent that is not
a wrapper.
</ul>

<p>
These relations are shown in this figure:

<p> A simple example of a wrapper is the BasicHighlighter class in
<b>diva.canvas.toolbox</b>. This class draws a translucent box around
its wrapped figure, and then forwards the paint() call to the
figure. The class ReshapeManipulator in <b>diva.canvas.interaction</b>
draws a set of grab-handles over the top of various points of the
child figure.

<p> Other classes shown in the diagram will not be implemented until a
future release of Diva. The RenderContext node contains a set of
parameters that define the current rendering context, such as the line
stroke and rendering style. The RenderQuality node attempts to provide
varying levels of rendering quality by adjusting rendering parameters.
It is intended for use in typical interactive applications, where
rendering quality can be sacrificed for performance during a user
interaction.  RenderQuality provides caching of a rendered figure,
again for use in interactive applications.
