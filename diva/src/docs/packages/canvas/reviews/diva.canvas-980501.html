 <P> Java2D is part of JDK 1.2, which also integrates Swing, so I'm
surprised you didn't base your components on JComponent.  As is they
would be heavyweight wouldn't they?  Also, "damage" is redundant; you
can use repaint.  In Swing, "glasses" aren't special, because you can
call setOpaque(false) on any JComponent, and the result of that is
that paint() will not automatically paint the background before
calling paintComponent(), therefore it will be transparent.  JFrames
have a layered architecture, including a "glass pane" that is on top
of everything, and you can add other layers.  You can also build
layered architectures inside JComponents, using things like
OverlayLayout and JLayeredPane (but I'm not an expert on that yet).  I
don't see a lot of value in your event dispatching changes either;
it's really not that big a deal to have to implement two listeners to
get all the mouse events (I wondered why too, but it's not worth much
nitpicking either).

 <P> Then there's the "figure", which is kindof a neat idea and many
people think that they need such a thing, although typically when
following the MVC pattern, you'd separate the view from the model
anyhow.  You can store a Shape in the model, and the view (subclassing
JComponent) can have a paintComponent which calls draw(Shape) on its
given Graphics2D.  "Features" are a good idea; so far I don't know of
any of this kind of support in Java2D.  Again, you need to separate
model from view and from control; if you allow the user to drag a
feature with the mouse, that is control functionality, and should
change the location of the feature within the "figure" model, not the
view.  The model then notifies the view(s).  Always assume there will
be more than one view/control combination for each model (users might
want to see two different perspectives or zoom levels on the same
drawing at the same time, and be able to edit in both windows).
Animation is a good idea and I don't think is supported much in 1.2.
Interactors appear to be a really good idea.  This area is a very
common weakness in many existing frameworks, and I haven't worked with
any really complete designs for this sort of thing yet so I'm not
quite as opinionated about what is the right way to do it.  :-) But
Taligent's CommonPoint seemed to have a decent design.  BTW have you
found any way to move the mouse cursor programmatically?  This seems
to be a Java shortcoming, and severely limits the kind of user
feedback you can give in situations where you want to constrain the
movement; you can constrain the movement of what is being dragged, but
not the cursor itself.

 <P> A drawing package is a "poster child" for MVC; I'd consider it a
must to separate the model, view, and control.  There is a lot less
blurring of those lines than there is in most "business" applications.

 <P> So in summary building a framework to make it easier to build
drawing packages is a good idea, but yours doesn't have broad enough
coverage of the needed features, yet, as well as arbitrarily
transmogrifying things that already work well enough.

Thanks for your comments -- very thought-provoking! There
is currently a compatibility problem with Swing and 2D,
but I do intend to use Swing eventually. I wasn't aware of
the layers support, so this is definitely something I will
use. Thanks for the tip, I'm still gqetting up to speed on the
2D API, Swing is a little down the track... I oscillated back
and forth on the new listeners -- I wanted a conceptual
separation between entering and leaving, and dragging, especially
for the interactors. But maybe you're right...

 <P> One thing I wasn't clear on: do you think every layer should be a
JComponent? I am planning on using layers as figures embedded within a
larger figure, for doing things like level of detail, zooming into
different visualization spaces, and so on. I have been somewhat
disconcerted by the complexity and performance (i.e. dismal) of
Swing...

 <P> On MVC: the canvas is purely part of the view (except for the
interactors sub-package). Each Figure has setModel and getModel
methods to access its model. I think that it's important not to have
things like Shapes in the model, since each view might render the
model in a completely different way. The location, maybe, but not the
appearance. Same deal with features: these support manipulation of the
on-screen representation, but where that comes from is entirely up to
the programmer. In an MVC-style architecture, it's coming via the
model. I am trying to be careful to keep the scope of this package
purely to supporting on-screen representation, without assuming
particular applications other than "interactive 2D."

If nothing else having two different models is extra clutter in a
programmer's mind, because he or she will never be able to escape the
official Sun event model anyway.

Well there isn't any higher base class for lightweight components,
unless you impart the lightweightness yourself (I did this once,
forget how...)  I guess you could just have an object for each layer
which stores Shapes to be drawn, and then in the layered component's
paintComponent just draw all the layers' Shapes in order, but that
seems like re-inventing the wheel to me.  Containment isn't that
expensive with Swing (but with peered components, each peer consumes a
Windows resource, and painting the various layers involves a lot of
going back and forth between Java code and native code; so that's why
I think complex arrangements of components should be lightweight).

Aha, good point.
