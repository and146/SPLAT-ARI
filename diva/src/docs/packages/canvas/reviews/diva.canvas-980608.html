Review called by John Reekie for the core package of his Diva canvas. Some
of the issues raised seemed to be due to John transferring some of the
code from Java2D based to Swing based.

<LI>
Figure Canvas should perhaps extend SwingComponent instead
of java.awt.Component

<blockquote>

I renamed FigureCanvas to JCanvas, and made it a subclass of
JComponent (the Swing root class). The internal architecture of the
canvas is now more complicated, in order to provide Swing
compatibility but keep performance "high."

</blockquote>

<LI>
 Should re-ordering among layers in Figure canvas be supported?

<blockquote>

The new internal architecture of the canvas has the JCanvas containing
a CanvasPane, which in turn contains CanvasLayers. Each layer is
assigned to an index within a canvas pane, thus giving clients a
simple way of rearranging layers. Layer indices don't have to be
continguous.  Lower-numbered layers are drawn on top of higher-numbered
layers.

 <P><B>Note</B>: this revision has been superseded as a result of
a subsequent re-review.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 Double buffering is currently allowed to be turned on
&amp; off. The reasons why it might want to be turned off are unclear.

<blockquote>

Now that JCanvas inherits from JComponent, it also inherits
the isDoubleBuffered and setDoubleBuffered methods. (It doesn't
need to override them.)

</blockquote>

<LI>
 In FigureContainer there is no description of what a Figure
is, perhaps a short description would be useful.

<blockquote>

There's a description at the start of the specification.

</blockquote>

<LI>
The method damage() in FigureContainer is the only one
that refers to the geometry of the container so it might be misplaced.

<blockquote>

I removed it.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 In the class/interface diagram under Container &amp; layers,
Figure is not an interface.

<blockquote>

Redrew the class diagram (see next item)

</blockquote>

<LI>
 It would be very helpful to have one big diagram of all
the classes and&nbsp; interfaces in the package showing&nbsp; how they
interrelate.

<blockquote>

Drew two class diagrams -- one for canvas, panes, and layers,
and one for figures and associated classes.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 The naming of FigureContainer and Layer interfaces could
perhaps reflect better what their roles are.

<blockquote>

I can't think of any better ones, really. Container is used in
AWT, so FigureContainer seems reasonable. I renamed Layer to
CanvasLayer in the hope that that might be clearer. Swing uses
layers in a similar way, so I think the term Layer is consistent
with Swing.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 In FigureContainer, the methods lower() and lower(Figure)
might need to be renamed to reflect exactly the tasks they perform.
e.g. lowerToBottom(), lowerBelow(Figure) ?

<blockquote>

I ended up with the following resolution. In the new
interface ZList, which abstracts the notion of an
ordered list of figures, I added methods 

<pre>
void add (int, Figure)
int indexOf (Figure)
void setIndex (int,Figure)
</pre>

Combined with a well-defined meaning of what indexes mean (lower
indexes are drawn above higher indexes, and -1 signifies the end of
the list), this allows all of this functionality to be implemented
without using awkward method names.

</blockquote>


<LI>
The same goes for raise(), raise(Figure)

<blockquote>

See above.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 The issue of offset(relative) Vs. absolute coordinates
needs to be looked at further. In particular, the issues raised when there
is more than one root layer.

<blockquote>

I resolved this issue by making all figure drawing take place
in "logical" coordinates in a canvas layer. Canvas layers can
be stacked into canvas panes, and ultimately, the top-level
canvas pane is part of a JCanvas -- this is the point where
logical coordinates can be mapped to screen coordinates.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 Does the outline of a figure need to be closed?

<blockquote>

Um. I'm not sure I understand this. If it means does the shape of a
figure need to be closed, then the answer is no: Java2D will draw
whatever shape you specify, closed or not.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 StrokedFigure should have a shape.

<blockquote>

Done.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 StrokedFigure and ShapedFigure might need to be renamed
to convey exactly what they do. Suggestion: BorderedFigure and FilledFigure

<blockquote>

I renamed ShapedFigure to FilledFigure, since that's what it's really
about. I decided to keep StrokedFigure as it is, partly because the
purpose of the interface is to give the figure a java.awt.Stroke
object that draws its outline, and partly because BorderedFigure would
be misleading for figures such as lines, which are stroked but do not
have a border.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 Figure Classes: perhaps add a comment to getFeatureSet()
saying exactly what a Feature point is.

<blockquote>

There's a description at the start of the document that
we skipped over in the review.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 should method hit() be called hits()?

<blockquote>

This is an awkward one, since it really should, but java.awt.Graphics2D
has hit() for a method with similar purpose, so I elected to
leave it as-is (and added a comment to the code).

</blockquote>

<LI>
 isContainedBy() might need to be renamed to avoid confusion
with parent container. This issue arose in several places. It might be
worthwhile looking at how AWT differentiates between the container and
the parent of an object.

<blockquote>

A similar comment applies to contains(), but since this
is in java.awt.Shape, I kept contains(). On examination, it
turns out that isContainedBy() is completely unncessary, as
<PRE>
figure.isContainedBy(rect)
</PRE>

would be the same as
<PRE>
rect.contains(figure.getBounds())
</PRE>

So I removed isContainedBy().

</blockquote>

<LI>
 repaint() method needs to be worked out further i.e.
exactly what it does and when it needs to be called.

<blockquote>

The repaint() methods of all classes are now consistent
with awt/awing and each other.

</blockquote>

<LI>
 Should the Glass classes be a sub package of the core
package?

<blockquote>

Probably not... With the new layered architecture, I need to
define a wrapper class that extends Figure and contains a
CanvasPane. This will be in the main package, but won't be
called Glass.

</blockquote>

<A NAME="concluding"></A>Concluding notes</H2>
Most of the issues raised at the review were concerned with naming and
placement of methods. An overall class diagram as suggested above would
help clarify what is going on a lot, and perhaps raise issues we couldn't
see today. In general for design reviews, a combination of an overall class
diagram and the javadoc output might be the easiest way to proceed.
