Re-review called by John Reekie for the top-level architecture of
diva.canvas, redesigned to deal with problems notes in the last review
with coordinate systems and Swing compatibility.  There was only one
reviewer (Neil Smyth) but sometimes you just have to work with what
you can get...

 <P>The reviewed file is tagged <CODE>version-0-3</CODE> in the diva
repository.

CanvasPane would be simpler if it just kept an order
list of layers, instead of the current non-contiguous
set of integers. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It would be! I made CanvasPane into an abstract class, so that
subclasses are required to provide the storage and access methods for
layers. This is better anyway, I think: rather than having a
complicated API that allow clients to manipulate layers in every way
possible, just let them define how they want the layers and provide
access to them.  In addition, I defined the class BasicCanvasPane,
which contains just a simple linear list of layers with a couple of
access methods.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI> CanvasLayer needs to be made consistent with
CanvasPane in the paint() and repaint() sets of methods.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Done.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI> FigureContainer.children() and ZList.overlapping()
each need to be made into two iterator methods, instead of
returning an array.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

I created the following methods:
<Pre>
Iterator FigureContainer.figures ()
Iterator FigureContainer.figuresFromFront ()
Iterator ZList.figuresOverlapping (Rectangle2D region)
Iterator ZList.figuresOverlappingFromFront (Rectangle2D region)
</pre>

Note the change from "children" to "figures," which I think is more
consistent with the meaning of the methods.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI> CanvasPane.addLayer(): order of arguments is wrong.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Fixed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<li> None of the methods in FigureContainer or ZList define
the behaviour in anomolous cases eg adding a figure that
already exists, and so on.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Decided and documented.

 <P>
Rework is still being done following the previous review.
In particular, the class diagrams need work.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

 <P> Now that I've starting writing this code, I am converting the
specification into the programmer's guide. It's too tedious keeping
the spec in sync with the code, as there are lots of small changes, so
refer to the API javadocs to verify the above changes.
