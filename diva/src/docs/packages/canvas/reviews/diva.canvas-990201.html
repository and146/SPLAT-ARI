This is a code review so the review materials are the source files as
listed below. The list is structured into groups, with each group
containing some pages from the design reference, followed by the list
of classes. Note that the pages from the design reference are not
under review, but are provided for context. The complete design
reference is <a href="../design/index.html">here</a>; a printable
(single file) version is <a
href="../design/printable.html">here</a>. To get all of the source
code for this and the next review, download this <a

<li>rewrite constructors so that it calls different constructor of the
same class rather than repeat the same code. Supports code reuse.

<blockquote>

Done in JCanvas, not for any other classes. There's a tradeoff between
"reuse" and obscurity. In some of these constructors, I would be
replacing two lines including a call to super() into one line that
calls another constructor.

</blockquote>

<li>JCanvas#paint()code for setting background to white is repeated in
both branches. Maybe call a private method to set the color.

<blockquote>

It's only a few lines of code. Generally, I find that code that wraps
up bits of code in obscure private methods is harder to understand,
and in this case I think creating another method would fall into that
category.

</blockquote>

<li>JCanvas#paint() A better comment explaining why we have offscreen
== null (for GC?)

<blockquote>
Done.
</blockquote>

<li>JCanvas#setCanvasPane() Doubly referenced stuff. Comment it so
that _canvasPane.setCanvas() is not called directly as that will lead
to bugs.

<blockquote>

I don't understand the first sentence. I added this comment to
CanvasPane.setCanvas(): <i> This method is not intended for general
use, only by JCanvas or subclasses.</i>

</blockquote>

<li>JCanvas#setPreferredSize setSize and getSize to refer to each
other. Probably should not call _canvasPane.setSize as that looks at
the between JCanvas.setSize is still setting size, etc. Neurendor
volunteered to explain this point better.

<blockquote>

Actually, I think this is correct, because these are two cases:
one when the CanvasPane is contained by a JCanvas and one
when it is not. I will draw an interaction diagram.

<P>[FIXME] 

</blockquote>

<li>CanvasPane#private variables Comments should be more informative
if there are comments at all.

<blockquote>

Firstly, I think it's good to consistently have a comment placeholder
for all variables. Secondly, that doesn't mean that you have to
duplicate information that's already in the set... method
corresponding to the variable.

</blockquote>

<li>CanvasPane#dispatchEventSystem.out.println and FIXME should
go. Bad message anyways.

<blockquote>
Fixed.
</blockquote>

<li>CanvasPane#processLayerEvent() Maybe layer should set the source
itself rather than calling setLayerSource() on the event separately.

<blockquote>

The intention is that application-specific subclasses of CanvasLayer
can be created, and so placing this in the CanvasPane relieves
subclass writers of this particular detail. In some cases the
call to setLayerSource() might be made twice buy this is not
a problem.

</blockquote>

<li>CanvasPane#setCanvas() Message in exception seems sort of
bogus. More clear message needed.

<blockquote>
Fixed, here and in setParent().
</blockquote>

<li>CanvasPane#setCanvas() Is "this._canvas" needed or should it just
be _canvas?

<blockquote>

It's not needed but I think that where you have both "_canvas"
and "canvas" visible in the same scope it's good practice to
add the "this" qualifier to clearly distinguish them.
 
</blockquote>

<li>CanvasPane# Probably clone the transform

<blockquote>

I don't think this is necessary. In general, set...() methods do not
clone the object being set, and in this case it's clearly documented
that the transform will be remembered by the pane. I added a comment
that any changes to the transform will affect the pane.

</blockquote>

<li>CanvasPane Wherever we have methods, use them rather than
accessing flags directly. Maybe these methods should be final. Perhaps
not final though so you can overwrite them later in derived classes.

<blockquote>

Hm. I guess the point is that either:
<ol>
<li> set/getXXX() methods can be overridden, in which case
the methods should be consistently used even in the defining
class; or

<li> set/getXXX() methods cannot be overridden, in which case
the defining class is free to access the private variables
as it wishes, sice it completely controls access to them.

</ol>

I have chosen the latter for the Beans-style setter and getter
methods, and made these methods final in CanvasPane, JCanvas,
CanvasLayer, and FigureLayer. Interestingly, this strategy showed up
an unneeded overridden method in FigureLayer, which I removed.

</blockquote>

<li>GraphicsPane#private variables ArrayList maybe an
overhead. Probably an array will do.

<blockquote>

Changed to use an array.

</blockquote>

<li>GraphicsPane#private variables Should be 5 not 6 in arrayList

<blockquote>
Fixed. Use a constant now.
</blockquote>

<li>GraphicsPane#Constructor reference the final static variables
rather than numbers directly.

<blockquote>
The array is now just a cache of the individual variables
 so the indexing constants no longer exist.
</blockquote>

<li>GraphicsPane#setBackGroundLayer Factor out setLayers methods 

<blockquote>
Dubious benefit. No change.
</blockquote>

<li>CanvasLayer#constructor() Should this even exist. If yes, then
should it be Setting the _containingPane to null or throw an
exception.

<blockquote>

It is used by GraphicsPane. GraphicsPane constructs its layers without
giving them itself as the parent, then it calls a common method on
each layer to initialize it. Rather than try and change the way
GraphicsPane works, I think it's better to leave this constructor in.

<p> _containingPane is already set to null. You can't throw an
exception or the GraphicsPane constructor will fail.

</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer# Comment about indices going from 0 to n ?

<blockquote>

I don't know if this applied to a specific method. At any rate, I
added the following line to the class comment: <i>Figures are also
stored at contiguous integer indexes, with index zero being the
"topmost" figure and the highest index being the "lowest" figure.</i>

</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#contains() and dispatch alpahabetic order of methods

<blockquote>
Oops... Fixed.
</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#get Comments about how indices are arranged to get
figure count, etc.

<blockquote>

I added the line: <i> Indexes are contiguous from zero to
getFigureCount()-1, with figures at lower indexes being displayed "on
top of" figures with higher indexes.</i>

</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#grabPointer Clear documentation about how this should
be used.

<blockquote>

This is a very specialized method so it requires some detailed
understanding of how the canvas works.  I tried to clarify with this
comment: 

<P><i> Typically, this method will be called from an Interactor
class in response to a mousePressed() event. The effect of calling
this method is to make the series of mouse events up to and including
the mouseReleased() event appear to be originating from the figure
<i>f</i> rather than the actual figure that was clicked on. For
example, if clicking and dragging on a graph node creates and the
drags a new edge, this method will be called after constructing the
edge to make the edge itself handle the mouse drag events instead of
the node.  </i>

</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#get() All the index related methods should be removed
as the zlist is anyway accessible.

<blockquote>

The problem with this proposal is that, if, for example, setIndex() is
removed, clients will need to remember to call repaint() or they will
get strange results. eg:

<pre>
   layer.getFigures().setIndex(index, figure);
   figure.repaint();
</pre>

Calling setIndex() is a reasonably common operation, for example, with
index zero it "raises" the figure to the top of the display
list. I have left the index-related methods as-is, I don't recall
any specific reason why they should be removed anyway.
 
</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#remove Factor out the common code from the methods.

<blockquote>
I don't understand, there are only two lines of code that could
be factored out.
</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#repaint appears that damage region is being modified
by TransformContext while everywhere else we assume that the pane
deals with that.(neurendor)

<blockquote>

The factory method createDamageRegion requires a transform context
argument, which is the context of the given coordinates. In this case,
the transform context that is passed to the factory method will
actually be the transform context of the containing pane, but that's
fine. No change.

</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#undecorate Should it be child.repaint()

<blockquote>
Yes, it should! Fixed.
</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#dispatchEventUpTree and dispatchMotionEvent Should
uptree transform the event?

<blockquote>

Since this review, Michael and I had a long discussion about
how/whether to transform the coordinates contained within events as
they were passed up and down the tree. I started to implement it, but
had second thoughts after I realized that it introduced more
complications for clients when dealing with transforms. After some
back and forth, I realized that every possible choice seems to have
about the same number of awkwardness dealing with transforms, and so
decided to stick with the current strategy. Specifically:

<ol>

<li> Layer events always contain coordinates in the  
transform context of the layer on which they originated.
This means that event coordinates change when recursing
into a nested pane, but not when merely changing contexts
between nested figures.

<li> The responsibility is on the client to transform layer
coordinates (as contained in the event) into the coordinates
of the context of a particular figure where the event might
have hit.

</ol>

</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#processLayerEvent looks like code got pulled out into
grabPointer but doesn't really call that method, instead repeats the
code.

<blockquote>
Fixed. processLayerEvent() now calls grabPointer().
</blockquote>

<li>FigureLayer#processLayerMotionEvent doesn't have any implementation.

<blockquote>
[FIXME]
</blockquote>

</ol>

<H2>
<A NAME="related"></A>Related issues</H2>
<LI>coderating flags should be in files

<blockquote>
Added Yellow to classes that are recognizable from
earlier design reviews, Red to other classes.
</blockquote>

<li>Comments at some places do not completely explain the
meanings. This is apparently to reduce duplication of
documentation. Maybe what needs to be done is to refer the user from
one method to another that has detailed comments. In specific,
CanvasPane#isEnabled comments are not very informative.

<blockquote>

The standard Java programming conventions say that setEnabled() and
isEnabled() are a pair, why does each need to explicitly refer to the
other? In general, I think it is adequate that setXXX() says what the
effect of setting the variable is. No change.

</blockquote>

<li>FIXMEs need to be fixed.

<blockquote>
[FIXME]
</blockquote>

<li>Exception messages should be more informative. They are quite
terse.

<blockquote>

I have made all exception messages more informative.
