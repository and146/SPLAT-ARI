<h2>Overview</h2>
</a>


A lot of the more primitive operations in an interactive editor
involve finding and working with sets of figures that span the
hierarchy in unpredictable ways.  This package contains a number of
interfaces and classes that assist with this process.

<h2>Interfaces</h2>
</a>

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>interface FigurePredicate</b>

<dd>
A predicate that can be applied to figures and used to filter
them. 

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>boolean apply ( Figure )</b>

<dd>
Return true if the figure satisfies this predicate, otherwise
false.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>interface FigureSet</b>

<dd>
<p> FigureSet is an interface for representing arbitrary set of figures,
possibly spanning the hierarchy in unpredictable ways. The contents
of the set is not calculated until it is needed, to avoid duplicating
large collections of objects.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>Enumeration elements ( )</b>

<dd>
Return an enumeration over the figure in the set.

<p>
<dt><b>void filter ( FigurePredicate )</b>

<dd>
Filter the set, retaining only those figures that 
satisfy the predicate.

</dl>

</dl>

<h2>Classes</h2>
</a>

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>class Selection implements FigureSet</b>

<dd>

A selection is a collection of figures that have been "selected."
This does not necessarily translate into actual selection
on the canvas, but that's usually how it's used.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>void add ( Figure )</b>

<dd> Add a figure to the selection.

<p>
<dt><b>void addItemListener ( ItemListener )</b>

<dd> Add an AWT item listener to this selection. The listener will
be notified whenever an item is added to or removed from the
selection.

<p>
<dt><b>void remove ( Figure )</b>

<dd> Remove a figure from the selection.

<p>
<dt><b>void removeItemListener ( ItemListener )</b>

<dd> Remove an AWT item listener from this selection.

<p>
<dt><b>void clear ( )</b>

<dd> Clear the selection.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>class FigureSubtree implements FigureSet</b>

<dd>

<p> FigureSubtree is a class that contains a sub-tree of the figure
hierarchy.  The contents of the set is not calculated until it is
needed, to avoid duplicating large collections of objects.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>FigureSubtree ( FigureCanvas )</b>

<dd>
Return a set containing all figures on the given canvas.

<p>
<dt><b>FigureSubtree ( Layer )</b>

<dd>
Return a set containing all figures on the given layer.

<p>
<dt><b>FigureSubtree ( CompositeFigure )</b>

<dd>
Return a set containing the given figure and all of its
descendents.

</dl>


<p>
<dt><b>abstract class BoundedSet implements FigureSet</b>

<dd>

<p> BoundedSet is a class that contains figures that
are bounded in some way by a rectangular region of a layer.
It is designed to support efficient incremental drag-selection.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>BoundedSet ( Point2D )</b>

<dd>Construct a new bounded set with origin and bound
at the given point. The "bound" is the opposite diagonal
from the origin, and can be in the positive or negative
direction in either axis.

<p>
<dt><b>Enumeration freshElements ( )</b>

<dd>Return an enumeration of figures added to the set since the most
recent call to <b>resize</b> or <b>translate</b>.  If there are no
fresh elements, this method returns null.

<p>
<dt><b>Rectangle2D getBounds ( )</b>

<dd>Return the current bounds as a legal rectangle.

<p>
<dt><b>boolean isRecursive ( )</b>

<dd>Return true if the set is recursively descending into nested
figures.

<p>
<dt><b>void resize ( double, double )</b>

<dd>Resize the bounds by the given distance. The distance can be
positive or negative. The <b>elements</b> method will now return the
enumeration of all bounded figures. All previously-obtained
enumerations are invalid and must be discarded.

<p>
<dt><b>void setRecursive ( boolean )</b>

<dd>Tell the set to recursively descend into nested figures.
The recursion will not go into layers. By default, recursion
is turned off.

<p>
<dt><b>Enumeration staleElements ( )</b>

<dd>Return an enumeration of figures removed from the set since the
most recent call to <b>resize</b> or <b>translate</b>. If there are no
stale elements, this method returns null.

<p>
<dt><b>void translate ( double, double )</b>

<dd>Move the whole region by the given distance. The distance can be
positive or negative. The <b>elements</b> method will now return the
enumeration of all bounded figures. All previously-obtained
enumerations are invalid and must be discarded.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>class OverlappingBoundedSet extends BoundedSet</b>

<dd>
This class specializes BoundedSet to include all figures that overlap
the bounding region. If recursion is turned on, descendent figures are
included only if they also overlap.

<p>
<dt><b>class EnclosedBoundedSet extends BoundedSet</b>

<dd>
This class specializes BoundedSet to include all figures that are
enclosed by the bounding region. If recursion is turned on, descendent
figures are included only if they are enclosed, even though their
parent figures may not be.
