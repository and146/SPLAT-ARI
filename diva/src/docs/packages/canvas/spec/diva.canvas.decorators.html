<a name="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
</a>

Typically, interactive editing programs need to draw additional
objects on the screen, such as highlighting, grab handles, and similar
paraphernalia. These items, while not directly part of the drawing,
still need to be created and managed.  This package provides the
interfaces and classes needed for a typical useful set.

<a name="interfaces">
<h2>Interfaces</h2>
</a>

 <P>
<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>interface Highlighter</b>

<dd>

<P> The interface implemented by objects that know how to
"highlight" figures.  By "highlight," we mean any operation that
creates some additional drawing on the screen that is attached to a
given figure.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>void highlight ( Figure )</b>

<dd> Highlight the figure. Typically, this operation will create one
or more new figures, add them to the parent figure just before the
highlighted figure, and add a component listener to the figure so that
it can move the highlight appropriately.

<p>
<dt><b>void rehighlight ( Figure )</b>

<dd> Re-highlight the figure. This operation is typically called if a
figure is already highlighted, but has changed in some way that
requires change in the highlights.

<p>
<dt><b>void unhighlight ( Figure )</b>

<dd> Remove highlighting from the given figure.

</dl>


<p>
<dt><b>interface GrabHandle extends Figure</b>

<dd>
<P> The interface implemented by objects that are used as grab-handles.
A grab-handle is notionally attached to a feature of a glyph.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>void deselect ( )</b>

<dd> Change the appearance of the grab-handle to make it look
deselected.

<p>
<dt><b>Feature getFeature ( )</b>

<dd> Get the feature to which this grab-handle is attached.

<p>
<dt><b>void select ( )</b>

<dd> Change the appearance of the grab-handle to make it look
selected.

<p>
<dt><b>void setGrabBehavior ( GrabBehavior )</b>

<dd> Set the behavior of this grab handle when it is moued on.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>interface GrabBehavior extends DragListener</b>

<dd>

<P> When a grab-handle is moved, it typically reshapes the glyph to
which it is attached by asking the glyph to move the corresponding
feature. Sometimes, however, more complex behavior is needed -- for
example, grab handles attached to a rectangle also need to cause other
grab-handles to move. This interface provides a way for glyphs to
tailor the behavior of their grab-handles. Classes that implement this
interface are assumed to create immutable objects.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>void ? ( )</b>

<dd> ?

</dl>


<p>
<dt><b>interface GrabHandleFactory</b>

<dd>
<P> The interface implemented by objects that produce grab-handles.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>GrabHandle create ( Feature )</b>

<dd> Create a new grab-handle on the given feature. The grab-handle is
created visible and inserted in a suitable place in the figure
hierarchy.

</dl>


</dl>


<a name="classes">
<h2>Classes</h2>
</a>

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>class BasicHighlighter implements Highlighter</b>

<dd>
<P> The basic highlighter highlights a figure by drawing
a colored shape just behind the figure.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>BasicHighlighter ( Paint )</b>

<dd> Construct a basic highlighter with the given paint.

<p>
<dt><b>static BasicHighlighter getInstance ( )</b>

<dd> Get the default highlighter instance.

</dl>


<p>
<dt><b>class BasicGrabHandle implements GrabHandle</b>

<dd>
<P> The basic grabhandle is a basic rectangle that is
unfilled when deselected and filled when selected.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>BasicGrabHandle ( Feature )</b>

<dd> Construct a basic grab-handle on the given feature.

</dl>


<p>
<dt><b>class BasicGrabHandleFactory implements GrabHandleFactory</b>

<dd>
<P> The basic grab-handle factory produces basic grab-handles.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>BasicGrabHandleFactory ( int )</b>

<dd> Construct a factory that produces basic grab-handles
of the given size.

</dl>
