<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>interface Feature</b>

<p>A <i>feature</i> represents a point on a figure. Features
are used to identify unique points on the figure and to reshape
the figure.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>public static int MOVEABLE</b>

<dd>The property that the feature can be moved. Features such as
"north-west corner" can be moved, while features such as "center"
generally cannot.

<p>
<dt><b>public static int GRABBABLE</b>

<dd>The property that the feature is a good candidate
for having a grab-handle attached to it.

<p>
<dt><b>public static int NORTHWEST</b>
<br><b>public static int NORTHEAST</b>
<br><b>public static int SOUTHWEST</b>
<br><b>public static int SOUTHEAST</b>
<br><b>public static int NORTH</b>
<br><b>public static int SOUTH</b>
<br><b>public static int WEST</b>
<br><b>public static int EAST</b>

<dd>The eight compass points.

<p>
<dt><b>public static int CENTER</b>

<dd>The center.

<p>
<dt><b>public static int VERTEX_N</b>

<dd>A flag that can be bit-wise or'ed with an integer
to indicate a vertex of a segmented figure. Up to
32 features can be indicated this way.

<p>
<dt><b>public static int FIRST_VERTEX</b>

<dd>The first vertex of an open segmented figure.

<p>
<dt><b>public static int LAST_VERTEX</b>

<dd>A last vertex of an open segmented figure.

<p>
<dt><b>int id ( )</b>

<dd>Return this feature's id, which indicates where it is on the figure.

<p>
<dt><b>void translate ( double, double )</b>

<dd>Reshape the figure by moving this feature the
given distance.

<p>
<dt><b>Figure getFigure ( )</b>

<dd>Get the figure that this feature belongs to.

<p>
<dt><b>Point2D getLocation ( )</b>

<dd>Get the current location of this feature, in layer
coordinates.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>interface FeaturePredicate</b>

<dd>
A predicate that can be applied to features and used to filter
them. 

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>boolean apply ( Feature )</b>

<dd>
Return true if the feature satisfies this predicate, otherwise
false.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>interface FeatureSet</b>

<dd>
<p> FeatureSet is an interface for representing a set of
features. The set can be a subset of the features supported
by a figure, or can include features from more than one
figure (for example, when performing selection of multiple
grab-handles).

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>Enumeration features ( )</b>

<dd>
Return an enumeration over the features of the set.

<p>
<dt><b>void filter ( FeaturePredicate )</b>

<dd>
Filter the set, retaining only those features that 
satisfy the predicate.

<p>
<dt><b>FigureListener getTranslater ( )</b>

<dd>
Get an object that will respond to coordinate movements
by translating all features in the set. If any features are not
movable, this will probably throw an exception, so the feature set
should be filtered appropriately. 

</dl>

</dl>

<a name="classes">
<h2>Classes</h2>
</a>

The classes in this package provide implementations of
feature for common shapes, such as rectangles and polygons.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>class RectangularFeatures implements FeatureSet</b>

<dd>

<p> RectangularFeatures is a class that implements a set of
features for rectangular shapes. The feature set is constructed by
passing it the rectangle to which it is to attach the features, and
a flag saying which features to include in the set.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>RectangularFeatures ( Rectangle2D, int )</b>

<dd>
Create the feature set on the given rectangle. The integer
flag must be either Feature.MOVABLE or Feature.GRABBABLE,
or one of the rectangular feature ids.

<p>
<dt><b>RectangularFeatures ( Rectangle2D, int [ ] )</b>

<dd>
Create the feature set on the given rectangle. The integer
array must contain rectangular feature ids.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>class SegmentedFeatures implements FeatureSet</b>

<dd>

<p> SegmentedFeatures is a class that implements a set of
features for shapes that have straight-line segments, such
as polygons. The feature set is constructed by
passing it the shape to which it is to attach the features, and
a flag saying which features to include in the set.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>SegmentedFeatures ( Shape, int )</b>

<dd>
Create the feature set on the given segmented. The integer
flag must be either Feature.MOVABLE or Feature.GRABBABLE,
or one of the vertex feature ids.

<p>
<dt><b>SegmentedFeatures ( Shape, int [ ] )</b>

<dd>
Create the feature set on the given segmented shape. The integer
array must contain vertex feature ids.
