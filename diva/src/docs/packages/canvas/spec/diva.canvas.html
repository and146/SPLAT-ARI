<h2>Overview</h2>
</a>

<p> The Diva canvas is implemented on top of the Java 2D API, and
provides a construction toolkit for interactive 2D viewers and
editors. <i>It is not a drawing package.</i> Its design is based on
our experiences with interactive editors and our goals for future work
that takes advantage of the 2D support in provided by the Java 2D API.

<p>The key concepts in this package are as follows:

<dl>

<p>
<dt><b>Figures</b>

<dd>A <i>figure</i> is a graphical item drawn on an AWT canvas.
Figures are constructed hierarchically -- they thus form a
tree. Figures are retained-mode objects -- for example, you can ask a
figure to move, and it will redraw itself in the new location.

<p>
<dt><b>Features</b>

<dd>Each figure has a set of <i>features</i>, which are points of
interest on the figure. A rectangular shape, for example, would have a
feature set that includes (at least) the four corners.  Other figures
can choose to define their own set -- for example, a figure used to
represent a terminal in a dataflow diagram may have a feature for the
attachment point.

<p>
<dt><b>Layers</b>

<dd> A layer is a logical grouping of a set of figures. A layer acts
as a kind of light-weight canvas, and can have a subset of the same
event listeners as JCanvas. Each layer maintains its own local
coordinate system, and can have a selection associated with it. The
top level of the canvas is implemented as one or more root layers.

<p>
<dt><b>Glass</b>

<dd> A <i>glass</i> is both a layer and a figure that is clipped to a
region of the canvas and that has a transparent or translucent
background. (The name is inspired by Xerox PARCs toolglasses.)
Glasses are used to implement multiple, overlapping, regions of the
canvas.  Conceptually, at least, glass can be used to implement
overlapping layers and portals (DataSplash), magic lenses and tool
glasses (Stone, Bier), translucent overlapping workspaces (Kramer), as
well as regular old overlapping windows.

<p>
<dt><b>Events</b>

<dd>The Diva canvas extends AWT's delegation-based event model to
figures. Each figure can have event listeners attached to it, which
will be notified when the dispatcher decides that an event belongs to
this figure. Events will be passed up the figure hierarchy until
consumed.

</ul>

 <P>In the following, methods are only shown the first time they occur
in a hierarchy. For example, <I>add</I> is shown in FigureContainer,
but not in Layer (which extends FigureContainer) or RootLayer (which
implements FigureContainer).



<a name="canvas">
<h2>The canvas, panes, and layers</h2>
</a>

<p>
The canvas is composed of a canvas pane, which in turn is composed of
one or more layers. Each layer may contain arbitrary graphics,
although commonly at least one layer is an instance of a "figure
layer" class that contains figure objects. The main role of the
JCanvas class is to provide the physical screen space on which layers
draw themselves, and to interface to the Swing component hierarchy.

<p>
This architecture allows a graphics developer to write code for a pane
and a set of layers, without being concerned about whether the pane
and its layers will be directly contained by a JCanvas or within some
other layer.  For example, it will be possible for a visualization
component to be "embedded" in a larger component.

 <P>
<center>
<img src="images/canvas.gif">
</center>

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>class JCanvas extends java.awt.swing.JComponent</b>

<dd>

The canvas is the Swing component that is used to contain figures. Its
main purpose is to provide a piece of physical screen real-estate that
contains a top-level CanvasPane.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>JCanvas ( )</b>

<dd>
Create a new canvas that contains a single CanvasPane,
which in turn contains a single FigureLayer. This is the simplest
way of using the JCanvas.

<p>
<dt><b>JCanvas ( CanvasPane )</b>

<dd>
Create a new canvas that contains the given CanvasPane.
This should be used if you need to make a canvas pane
that contains more than a single layer.

<p>
<dt><b>CanvasPane getCanvasPane ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the canvas pane contained by this component.

<p>
<dt><b>void paint ( Graphics )</b>
<br><b>void paint ( Graphics, Rectangle2D )</b>
<dd>
Paint the canvas. In versions with additional arguments, the arguments
are the damaged region of the canvas. This will be passed to the
<b>paint</b> method of the contained canvas pane and have to its
layers, so that they can optimize the paint to paint only the given
region.

<p>
<dt><b>void repaint ( )</b>
<br><b>void repaint ( Rectangle2D )</b>
<br><b>void repaint ( long tm, int z, int y, int w, int h )</b>

<dd>
Schedule a repaint of the canvas. In the versions with additional
arguments, the additional arguments represent the damaged region of
the canvas, which is selectively merged with existing damage regions.
These methods override methods inherited from <b>java.awt.Component</b>
and <b>java.awt.swing.JComponent</b>. 

<p>
<dt><b>void setCanvasPane ( CanvasPane )</b>

<dd>
Set the canvas pane contained by this component.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>interface TransformedComponent</b>

<dd>

A transformed component is any component that maps "logical" internal
coordinates to "absolute" screen coordinates using an instance of
AffineTransform. It is used for components that can scale themselves.
Logical coordinates can be integer or floating-point, whereas screen
coordinates are always integer. Methods in the interface convert
screen coordinates to logical coordinates and vice-versa. Note that
the transform can be read (and modified, in which case this interface
does not define the behavior), but cannot be set.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>Point2D fromScreen ( Point2D )</b>
<br><b>Rectangle2D fromScreen ( Rectangle2D )</b>
<br><b>Shape fromScreen ( Shape )</b>

<dd>
Convert screen coordinates into logical coordinates. If this object
does not return true for the <b>isOrthogonal</b> method, then the
Rectangle2D version of this method will throw an exception, since a
rectangle cannot be mapped into a rectangle in the presence of
rotation or shear. If the transformation produces a non-integer value,
then the value will not be truncated or rounded to the nearest integer
-- it is the responsibility of the client to check for this if it's
important.

<p>
<dt><b>JCanvas getCanvas ( )</b>

<dd> Get the canvas that this pane lives in. This will be null if the
pane hasn't been put into a canvas yet (with JCanvas.setCanvasPane()),
or has been removed from a canvas.

<p>
<dt><b>AffineTransform getTransform ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the transform that maps logical coordinates into screen
coordinates. If the tranform is null, then the mapping is one-to-one.

<p>
<dt><b>AffineTransform getInverseTransform ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the transform that maps coordinates into logical
coordinates. If the tranform is null, then the mapping is one-to-one.

<p>
<dt><b>boolean isOrthogonal ( )</b>

<dd> Return true if a rectangle in logical coordinates can be mapped
to a rectangle on the screen (and vice versa).

<p>
<dt><b>Point2D toScreen ( Point2D )</b>
<br><b>Rectangle2D toScreen ( Rectangle2D )</b>
<br><b>Shape toScreen ( Shape )</b>

<dd>
Convert logical coordinates into screen coordinates. If this objects
does not return true for the <b>isOrthogonal</b> method, then the
Rectangle2D version of this method will throw an exception, since a
rectangle cannot be mapped into a rectangle in the presence of
rotation or shear.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>abstract class CanvasPane implements TransformedComponent</b>

<dd>

A canvas pane groups canvas layers. The layers all share the same
logical-to-screen transform as the canvas pane. This is an abstract
superclass of all canvas panes, and provides the implementation of
everything related to panes but the storage of the layers. Subclasses
must provide methods to add and (possibly) reorder and remove layers.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>abstract Iterator layers ( )</b>

<dd>
Return an iteration of the layers, in redraw order (that is,
from back to front).

<p>
<dt><b>abstract Iterator layersFromFront ( )</b>

<dd>
Return an iteration of the layers, in event-processing order (that is,
from front to back).

<p>
<dt><b>void paint ( Graphics2D )</b>
<br><b>void paint ( Graphics2D, Rectangle2D )</b>
<dd>
Paint the pan. Note that the graphics object must be an instance
of java.awt.Graphics2D, not java.awt.Graphics. These methods
forward the paint request to each layer, in redraw order.

<p>
<dt><b>void processEvent ( EventObject )</b>

<dd> Process an event that has occured on the pane.  Coordinates in
the event object will be in layer (logical) for canvas layer events
(see the package diva.canvas.event), and in screen coordinates for
other event types. This implementation passes the event to each layer,
from lowest to highest index. After each layer, the pane checks
whether the event has been consumed, and returns if so. Subclasses can
choose to override this behavior.

<p>
<dt><b>void repaint ( )</b>
<br><b>void repaint ( Rectangle2D )</b>
<br><b>void repaint ( long tm, int z, int y, int w, int h )</b>

<dd>
Schedule a repaint of the pane. These methods mimic the repaint
methods in JCanvas. Each converts coordinates from logical coordinates
to absolute coordinates if necessary, and forwards the repaint
request to the containing canvas.

<p>
<dt><b>void setTranform ( AffineTransform )</b>

<dd>
Set the transform that maps logical coordinates into screen
coordinates. Setting it to null makes the mapping one-to-one.

</dl>



<p>
<dt><b>class BasicCanvasPane extends CanvasPane</b>

<dd>

A basic implementation of a canvas pane, provided for simple
applications. This class keeps a linear list of canvas layers, and
provides a couple of methods so that layers can be added to it. Real
applications will probably want to create their own CanvasPane
subclass, instead of using this class.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>void addLayer ( CanvasLayer )</b>

<dd> Add the given layer to the end of the list of layers.  The new
layer will be drawn over the top of any existing layers.

<p>
<dt><b>Iterator layers ( )</b>

<dd>
Return an iteration of the layers, in redraw order (that is,
from back to front).

<p>
<dt><b>Iterator layersFromFront ( )</b>

<dd>
Return an iteration of the layers, in event-processing order (that is,
from front to back).

<p>
<dt><b>void removeLayer ( CanvasLayer )</b>

<dd>
Remove the given layer. Do nothing if the layer is not
contained in this pane.

</dl>



<p>
<dt><b>abstract class CanvasLayer implements TransformedComponent, LayerEventSource</b>

<dd>
A canvas layer is a single layer on which figures can be drawn.
Layers can be made visible or not, and can contain any arbitary
graphics (i.e. not necessarily Figures).

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>boolean isVisible ( )</b>

<dd> Test the visibility flag of this layer.

<p>
<dt><b>abstract void paint ( Graphics2D )</b>
<br><b>abstract void paint ( Graphics2D, Rectangle2D )</b>

<dd>
Paint the layer. Note that the graphics object must be an instance
of java.awt.Graphics2D, not java.awt.Graphics. These abstract methods
muct be overridden by concrete subclasses to check for visibility,
and then paint the layer's contents.

<p>
<dt><b>abstract void processEvent ( EventObject )</b>

<dd>
Process an event that has occured on this layer.  Coordinates in the
event object will be in layer (logical) coordinates for canvas events
(see <b>diva.canvas.event</b>), and in screen coordinates otherwise.

<p>
<dt><b>void repaint ( )</b>
<br><b>void repaint ( Rectangle2D )</b>
<br><b>void repaint ( long tm, int z, int y, int w, int h )</b>

<dd>
Schedule a repaint of the layer. These methods forward the
repaint request to the containing pane.

<p>
<dt><b>void setVisible ( boolean )</b>

<dd>
Set the visibility flag of this layer. If the flag is false, then the
layer will not be drawn on the screen and it will not respond to user
input events.

</dl>


<p>
<dt><b>interface FigureContainer</b>

<dd>
An interface implemented by objects that contain figures. The
container can have figures added to or removed from it, and can be
queried for its contents.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>void add ( Figure )</b>

<dd>
Add a figure to the container's children. This interface does not
define where the new figure will be in the display order (i.e. at the
top, bottom, or somewhere else), although implementations may define
this.

<p>
<dt><b>Iterator figures ( )</b>

<dd>
 Return an iteration of the figures in this container, from
highest index to lowest index. This is the order in which
figures should normally be painted, so that figures at lower
indexes are painted over the top of figures at higher indexes.

<p>
<dt><b>Iterator figuresFromFront ( )</b>

<dd>
Return an iteration of the figures in this container, from
lowest index to highest index. This is the order in which
events should normally be intercepted.

<p>
<dt><b>void remove ( Figure )</b>

<dd>
Remove a figure from this container.

</dl>


<p>
<dt><b>interface ZList extends FigureContainer</b>

<dd>

A ZList is an interface for objects that contain an ordered list of
figures in z-order. In addition to the methods inherited from
FigureChildren, ZList has methods for reordering figures in the list,
and in the future may have methods for locating objects in 2D space.
This interface is used to isolate the implementation of figure
containers from the z-list, to allow future optimization of the z-list
implementation.

<p> This interface tries to mimic the AWT Container and Swing
JLayerPane interfaces where possible. Unfortunately, these two classes
differ on the relation between list ordering and display ordering, so
we have chosen to use the AWT Container order (high-numbered elements
are displayed <i>below</i> lower-numbered elements), since we thought
it would make using the <b>add</b> method less error-prone.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>void add ( int, Figure )</b>

<dd> Insert a figure at the given position. To insert the figure just
in front of some other figure, use <b>getIndex</b> to get the other
figure's index, and call <B>add</B> with <I>index</I> as the index
argument. To insert the figure just behind some other figure, call
<B>add</B> with <I>index+1</I> as the index argument. To insert so the
figure displays over the top of other figures, insert at
zero. Following AWT convention, the index <i>-1</i> means to add the
component at the end of the list.

<p>
<dt><b>Iterator figuresOverlapping (Rectangle2D region)</b>

<dd> Return an iteration of the figures in this container that overlap
the given rectangle, from highest index to lowest index. This is the
order in which figures are normally painted, so that figures at lower
indexes overlap figures at higher indexes.

<p>
<dt><b>Iterator figuresOverlappingFromFront (Rectangle2D region)</b>

<dd> Return an iteration of the figures in this container that overlap
the given rectangle, from lowest index to highest index. This is
the order in which events are normally intercepted.

 <p>
<dt><b>Figure get ( int )</b>

<dd> Return the figure at the given index.

 <p>
<dt><b>int indexOf ( Figure )</b>

<dd> Return the index of the given figure in the Z-list.  Figures with
a higher index are drawn behind figures with a lower index.

<P>
<dt><b>void remove ( int )</b>

<dd> Remove the figure at the given position in the list.

<P>
<dt><b>void setIndex ( int, Figure )</b>

<dd>
Set the index of the given figure -- in other words, move it in
the display list to the given position.  To move the figure to just in
front of some other figure, use <b>getIndex</b> to get the other
figure's index, and call <B>setIndex</B> with <I>index</I> as the
index argument. To move the figure to just behind some other figure,
call <B>setIndex</B> with <I>index+1</I> as the index argument. (Other
figures will have their indexes changed accordingly.)

</dl>


<p>
<dt><b>class BasicZList implements ZList</b>

<dd>
A basic implementation of the figure z-list, provided for initial
implementations of figure containers.

<dl>

<p>
<dt><b>class FigureLayer extends CanvasLayer implements ZList</b>

<dd>
A figure layer is a canvas layer that contains figures.  This is the
main class that is accessed when figures are drawn.

<P>
<dt><b>FigureLayer ( )</b>

<dd> Create a new figure layer that is not in a pane. The layer will
not be displayed, and its coordinate tranformation will be as though
it were a one-to-one mapping. Use of this constructor is strongly
discouraged, as many of the geometry-related methods expect to see a
pane.

<P>
<dt><b>FigureLayer ( CanvasPane )</b>

<dd> Create a new figure layer within the given pane.

<P>
<dt><b>FigureLayer ( CanvasPane, ZList )</b>

<dd> Create a new figure layer within the given pane and with the
given ZList to hold the figures it contains.

<P>
<dt><b>FigureLayer ( ZList )</b>

<dd> Create a new figure layer with the given ZList to hold its
figures. This can be used to create a more efficient z-list than the
default, which is an instance of BasicZList.

</dl>
</dl>

<h2>Figures</h2>
</a>


A figure is a persistent representation of one or more Java 2D shapes.
A figure have methods that deal with its screen representation, methods that
deal with its position in the hierarchy, and methods that deal with
its interaction with the canvas and other objects.

 <P> Figures form a hierarchy -- they are a classic example of the
<I>Composite</i> design pattern.

 <P>
<center>
<img src="images/figures.gif">
</center>

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>interface FilledFigure</b>

<dd>
An interface that can be implemented by classes that are identifiable
in some way with a single shape, either as their main component or as
some kind of outline or background.

<dl>
<p>
<p>
<dt><b>Composite getComposite ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the color composition operator of this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>Paint getFillPaint ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the fill paint pattern of this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>Shape getShape ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the shape of this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>void setComposite ( Composite )</b>

<dd>
Set the color composition operator of this figure. The compositioning
applies to the fill only.

<p>
<dt><b>void setFillPaint ( Paint )</b>

<dd>
Set the fill paint pattern of this figure. The figure will be filled with
this paint pattern. If no pattern is given, do not fill it.

<p>
<dt><b>void setShape ( Shape )</b>

<dd>
Set the shape of this figure.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>interface StrokedFigure</b>

<dd>
An interface for figures that have a stroke.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>Shape getShape ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the shape of this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>Stroke getStroke ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the stroke of this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>Paint getStrokePaint ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the stroke paint pattern of this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>void setShape ( Shape )</b>

<dd>
Set the shape of this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>void setStroke ( Stroke )</b>

<dd>
Set the stroke of this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>void setStrokePaint ( Paint )</b>

<dd> Set the stroke paint pattern of this figure.

</dl>


<p>
<dt><b>abstract class Figure</b>

<dd> Figure is an abstract class that roots all figures drawn on a
FigureCanvas. Sub-classes define a screen representation. Figures must
not cause themselves to repaint in response to an operation (such as
translate) -- repaint must be initiated explicitly by the client by a
call to the canvas' <I>repaint</I> method.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>boolean contains ( Point2D )</b>

<dd> Test whether this figure contains the point given.  The point
given is in layer coordinates.

<p>
<dt><b>Rectangle2D getBounds ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the bounding box of this figure.  The result
rectangle is given in layer coordinates.

<p>
<dt><b>EventDispatcher getEventDispatcher ( )</b>

<dd>
Return the event dipatcher attached to this figure. Return null
if there isn't one.

<p>
<dt><b>FeatureSet getFeatureSet ( )</b>

<dd>
Return the set of features of this figure. This method can return
null if the figure doesn't support any features.

<p>
<dt><b>Layer getLayer ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the most immediate layer containing this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>Object getModel ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the model that this figure represents. Return null
if there is no model.

<p>
<dt><b>Shape getOutline ( )</b>

<dd> Get the outline shape of this figure.  The outline shape is used
for things like highlighting.  The result shape is given in layer
coordinates.

<p>
<dt><b>FigureContainer getParent ( )</b>

<dd> Return the parent of this figure. Return null if the figure does
not have a parent. (Note that a figure with no parent can exist, but
it will not be displayed, as it must be in a layer for the figure
canvas to ever call its <B>paint</B> method.

<p>
<dt><b>abstract boolean hasChildren ( )</b>

<dd> Return true if this figure has child figures, otherwise false.

<p>
<dt><b>boolean hit ( Rectangle2D )</b>

<dd> Test if this figure intersects the given rectangle, and the
interior of the figure is not transparent to hits. This is the same as
<i>intersects</i> if the interior of the figure is not
transparent. The rectangle is given in layer coordinates.

<p>
<dt><b>boolean intersects ( Rectangle2D )</b>

<dd> Test if this figure intersects the given rectangle. The rectangle
is given in layer coordinates.

<p>
<dt><b>boolean isVisible ( )</b>

<dd> Test the visibility flag of this figure. Note that this flag does
not indicate whether the figure is <I>actually</I> visible on the
screen, as one if its ancestors may not be visible.

<p>
<dt><b>abstract void paint ( Graphics2D )</b>
<br><b>abstract void paint ( Graphics2D, Rectangle2D )</b>

<dd> Repaint the figure. If a rectangle is given, the figure should
use the rectangle to optimize redraw. The redrawing will be clipped to
the rectangle.  The rectangle is given in layer coordinates.

<p>
<dt><b>void repaint ( )</b>

<dd> Schedule a repaint of the figure. This should be called after
performing modifications on the figure, so that the figure is
scheduled for redrawing.

<p>
<dt><b>void setEventDispatcher ( EventDispatcher )</b>

<dd> Set the event dispatcher for this figure. Once a figure has an
event dispatcher attached to it, it will respond to events that occur
on the figure canvas. The events that it responds to is determined by
the current state of the event dispatcher.

<p>
<dt><b>void setModel ( Object )</b>

<dd> Often, a figure represents some underlying information.  This
methods sets an object that can be retrieved with the <I>getModel</I>
method, that is intended for use as a reference to the semantic model.

<p>
<dt><b>protected void setParent ( CompositeFigure )</b>

<dd> Set the parent of this figure.  If the figure already has a
parent, the new parent will silently replace the old one -- this
allows this method to propagate the layer information down a tree.  If
the argument is null, then the figure is being informed that it has
been removed from its parent.

<p>
<dt><b>void setVisible ( boolean )</b>

<dd>Set the visibility flag of this figure. If the flag is false,
then the figure will not be drawn on the screen and it will
not respond to user input events.

<p>
<dt><b>void transform ( AffineTransform )</b>

<dd>
Transform the figure with the supplied transform. This can be used to
perform arbitrary translation, scaling, shearing, and rotation
operations.

<p>
<dt><b>void translate ( double, double )</b>

<dd>
Move the figure the indicated distance.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>abstract class LeafFigure extends Figure</b>

<dd>

A leaf figure is a figure that contains no children. This kind of
figure contains one or more instances of <i>Shape</i>, which it uses
to render itself and perform hit detection. (Leaf figures can in fact
contain other figures, but rendering must be initiated "manually.")
This class must be subclassed to produce concrete figures.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>boolean hasChildren ( )</b>

<dd> Always returns false.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>class CompositeFigure extends Figure implements FigureContainer</b>

<dd> A composite figure is a figure that contains child figures. On
its own, this class implements a simple visible collection of
figures. It can be subclassed to produce specific kinds of
composite figure.


<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>CompositeFigure ( )</b>

<dd>
Create a new composite figure containing no figures.

<p>
<dt><b>CompositeFigure ( FigureSet )</b>

<dd>
Create a new composite figure containing the given figures.
An exception will be thrown if any figure already has a parent.

</dl>

<p>
<dt><b>class SimpleFigure extends LeafFigure
		implements FilledFigure, StrokedFigure</b>

<dd> A simple figure is one that contains a single instance of
<i>Shape</i>.  There are few convenience subclasses of this class, as
in general it is better to just create them on-the-fly.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>SimpleFigure ( Shape )</b>

<dd>
Create a new figure with the given shape. The figure, by default,
has the unit-width continuous stroke and no paint pattern.

<p>
<dt><b>SimpleFigure ( Shape, Stroke )</b>

<p>
<dt><b>class ImageFigure extends LeafFigure</b>

<dd> An image figure contains an image that can be efficiently blitted
to the screen. Image figures can be used to efficiently make multiple
figures, each containing a reference to a single image. When an image
figure is constructed with an image figure passed as argument, it
simply creates a reference to the image in that figure. If any other
figure is passed as an argument, the new figure takes a "snapshot" of
that figure.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>ImageFigure ( Image )</b>

<dd>
Create a new figure containing the given image.

<p>
<dt><b>ImageFigure ( Figure )</b>

<dd>
Create a new figure containing an image snapshot of the given figure.
If the figure is an fact an image figure, then just use its image.

<p>
<dt><b>Image getImage ( )</b>

<dd>
Get the image contained in this figure.

<p>
<dt><b>void setImage ( Image )</b>

<dd>
Set the image contained in this figure.

<a name="glass">
<h2>Glass</h2>
</a>

<p> <i>Glass</i> is a special kind of figure, that is also a layer.  It
is a kind of "light-weight, see-through canvas" within a canvas.  Glass
implements the FilledFigure interface for its overall shape and
background. A glass maintains a transform that can be altered at any
time (the simpler figures apply the transform immediately if a
transform is requested). This means that stroke widths, font sizes,
and paint patterns are scaled by scaling transformations. (I think.)

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>class Glass extends AbstractFigure implements Layer, FilledFigure</b>

<dd>Glass is a concrete class, that, in effect, implements a
light-weight canvas within a canvas. Glasses can of course be nested
within each other.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>Glass ( Shape )</b>

<dd>Create a new glass with the given shape. The shape
is given in layer coordinates.

<p>
<dt><b>void addMouseListener ( MouseListener )</b>

<dd> Add a standard AWT mouse listener to this glass.

<p>
<dt><b>void addMouseMotionListener ( MouseMotionListener )</b>

<dd> Add a standard AWT mouse motion listener to this glass.

<p>
<dt><b>void removeMouseListener ( MouseListener )</b>

<dd> Remove a standard AWT mouse listener from this glass.

<p>
<dt><b>void removeMouseMotionListener ( MouseMotionListener )</b>

<dd> Remove a standard AWT mouse motion listener from this glass.
