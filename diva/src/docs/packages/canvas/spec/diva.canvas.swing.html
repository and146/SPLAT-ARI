<h2>Overview</h2>
</a>

This package contains interfaces and wrappers for making the canvas
and figure inter-oprtate with Swing.  When designing the canvas, we
made the conscious choice not to use the Swing architecture internally
to the canvas. We wanted figures to be a light-weight as possible, and
we wanted traversal, editing and repainting of the figure hierarchy to be fast.
There were other difficulties as well -- for example, the scalability
of the canvas does not match well with Swing's (reasonable)
assumption that components are mapped directly to the screen.

<p>
As a result, we decided to keep figures essentially independent
of the Swing graphics hierarchy, and to provide ways to
have the two interact in controlled ways. Firstly, JCanvas
_is_ a Swing component, so can be used anywhere a Swing component
can be used. Secondly, we have provided in this package some wrappers
for Swing components, that allow Swing components to live within
a figure hierarchy and be dragged and scaled like an figure, but
also to act as regular Swing components.
