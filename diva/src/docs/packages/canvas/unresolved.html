<h1>Unresolved canvas issues</h1>

<dl>

<dt><i>Swing</i>

<dd> Uh-oh. The big one. Why isn't a Figure a Swing widget?
Why do I need to put CanvasPane in a PaneWrapper instead of using
Swing's component nesting?

<p> The answer to the first question is that Swing widgets, in spite
of what Sun's marketing machine says, are large and slow. Figures are
small and (given the underlying platform) reasonable fast. We're
interested in creating components with zillions of Figures on them, so
we took some pains to keep them small.

<p> The answer to the second question is that we don't really know.
We wrote PaneWrapper as a first attempt at exploring nested
"surfaces," and have been wanting to figure out to integrate them with
Swing properly, but it just hasn't been a priority so far. If you have
made custom Swing widgets with Java2D, email us some code.

<dt><i>3D</i>

<dd> OK, here's another big one. Early on, we wondered about this, and
decided that the canvas would, for all intents and purposes, be
fundamentally 2D. There are lots of interesting issues in 2D
information representation, which tend to get forgotten with 3D
environments. The kind of issues you deal with when you scribble or
draw in your notepad, for example. (When was the last time you saw
anyone use a 3D sketch-pad?)

<p> So, maybe later it would be cool to try layering Java2D over
Java3D and extending the Diva look into the third dimension, but for
now we don't really care that much :-)
