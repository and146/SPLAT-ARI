<H1>The Diva graph display package</H1>
<H2>1.0 Introduction</H2>
<P><I>diva.graph</I> is the high-level facade of the graph package and responsible for the display of graphs. It
contains the graph display widget, JGraph, and a bunch of other user interface components, including visual representations
of nodes and edges, and some default node/edge behaviors. This package is strongly dependent on the Diva canvas,
but the rest of the graph package is not dependent on this package, so alternative implementations should be easy
to write. If your application has no special graph data structure or layout requirements, you should be able to
use this package without knowing much at all about the other packages. In fact, if your application has no special
display requirements, you should be able to use the whole thing without knowing much about this package either!

<H3>2.1 JGraph</H3>
<P>JGraph is the centerpiece of the graph package, a customizable Swing widget which allows users to view and interact
with graphs. By constructing the widget and placing it in a window, the user can place nodes in the graph, draw
edges between the nodes, move the nodes and disconnect/delete the edges. All of this is captured by the following
snippet of code:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>JFrame f = new JFrame();
f.getContentPane().add(&quot;Center&quot;, new JGraph());
f.setSize(800, 600);
f.setVisible(true);</PRE>

<H3>2.2 GraphPane and Figures</H3>
<P>The graph pane ultimately is responsible for the display of the graph. However, the display smarts and customization
facilities are located elsewhere. GraphPane is simply a diva.canvas.GraphicsPane with a few graph-specific methods
for setting up the relation with the GraphView and GraphController classes, described below. It contains Diva canvas
figures, which happen to represent graph entities, but it doesn't understand the graph semantics per se.</P>
<H3>2.3 GraphView and GraphController</H3>
<P>All of the customization of the graph display and editing behavior is done within GraphView and GraphController.</P>

<P>GraphView is a class which holds node and edge renderers to produce a visual representation of the nodes and
edges in the graph, and an incremental layout engine which it uses to place newly-added nodes and route newly-added
edges. There are several classes which make it easier to write renderers, most notably TypedNode/EdgeRenderer,
which allows users to register specific renderers based on the type of the user data in the respective node/edge
that is being rendered.</P>

<P>GraphController is the point of extensibility for editing behavior. It is an interface, so it can be rewritten
from scratch. It is responsible for listening to changes in the graph and responding by asking the view to render
and layout the resulting figures. The GraphController is responsible both for implementing a policy for dealing
with inconsistencies in the graph and for annotating the rendered node and edge figures with appropriate user interaction
behavior.</P>
