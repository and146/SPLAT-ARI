<H1>Graph interaction design document</H1>
<H2>1.0 Introduction</H2>
<P>While the Diva canvas provides a good abstraction for event-handling and interaction in a structured graphics
environment, this abstraction can be improved upon for the particular purpose of graph editing.  This document
describes the design of a graph interaction package in which a particular application can easily customize the
behavior of the editor by receiving high-level &quot;graph interaction events&quot;.  We start by describing the
sort of things we'd like to be able to do while editing graphs to motivate this abstraction and give a description
of the architecture which accomplishes this.</P>
<H2>2.0 Design</H2>
<P>There are a couple obvious configurations that an interactive graph editor should have.  A hierarchical graph
is about <I>containment</I> (graphs containing nodes, and compound nodes containing other nodes) and <I>connectivity</I>
(edges connecting nodes at various levels of nestedness), so these two things are explained separately.</P>
<H3>2.1 Node dragging</H3>
<P>The way a user interactively modifies containment in a graph is to drag nodes out of one compound node and into
another.  However, depending on the application, it might not make sense for a user to place certain nodes inside
other nodes.  In our design, the application is given the opportunity to veto users drags by throwing an exception
when it receives a dropped callback.  The application's exception handler will replace the node at its previous
position before the user began dragging.  Furthermore, the application may wish to give the user visual feedback
as the user drags nodes, based on some semantic property of the layout (e.g. the color the node being dragged by
its &quot;affinity&quot; to the nearst neighbor node).  By using general callbacks which correspond to every &quot;interesting&quot;
event in the user's dragging of a node:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The start of a node drag
	<LI>As a node is dragged
	<LI>When a node is dragged out of a subgraph
	<LI>When the node is dragged into a subgraph
	<LI>When the node is dropped
</UL>

<P>
<H3>2.2 Edge dragging</H3>
<P>Edge dragging is very similar to node dragging, but is slightly more complicated because more entities are involved.
 Certain edges should not be able to connect to certain nodes, depending on the semantics of the application or
the particular state of the program.  Similarly, the user might wish to update the visual appearance of the edge
(e.g. its color, dashed-ness, etc.) as it is dragged, to reflect some property of the system.  There are actually
two cases of edge dragging: as an edge is created for the first time, and as an edge is re-connected between two
different nodes.  The callbacks which relate to edge connectivity are:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>As the edge drag is starting (either as it is being created from one node, or as it is being dragged away from
	one node)
	<LI>As the edge is dragged
	<LI>As the edge is dragged out of a node/subgraph
	<LI>As the edge is dragged into a node/subgraph
	<LI>As the edge is dropped
</UL>
