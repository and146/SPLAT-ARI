<H4>Author's Response</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>This design review was extremely useful to me. I didn't agree with all the points that were raised, but the
	general message that I took away from the meeting was that the facade pattern of the GraphModel class was not completely
	understood, and this was due to ambiguity in the fact that Nodes/Edges/Graphs were given a full and self-consistent
	interface. It occurred to me that if it all topology-editing operations were done through the GraphModel interface
	and that the only low-level operations were &quot;read&quot; operations and &quot;userObject/property&quot; calls,
	then nearly all of the problems and ambiguities brought up in the design review would be fixed. I am writing a
	new version of the overview document which will discuss this in more detail.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Overview Document</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Diagram: Graph not necessarily have GraphModel


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Diagram: GraphModel has multiple GraphListeners


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Overview: remove summary of classes


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Shortened and integrated into overview section.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>GraphModel: doesn't send event on Node/Edge actions: seems dangerous


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Redesigned. In the new design, low-level &quot;write&quot; operations are only possible through the GraphModel
	interface. For efficiency it is possible to turn off notifications on the GraphModel. However, when the notifications
	are turned back on after an algorithm has completed, it will dispatch a STRUCTURE_CHANGED event to cause clients
	to refresh their views.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Better support for hyper-edges? (NodeSet)


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Though this graph package is general, its primary goal is as a data structure for a graph visualization system.
	Because decisions made at this level must be supported by visualization front-ends, it is easier to make the graph
	interface as minimal as possible, and since hyper-edges can be simulated using specially-tagged nodes, this is
	probably the easiest for front-ends to deal with.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Directedness: where implemented: property container or fundamental?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Neither. I was going to implement directedness and other &quot;common properties&quot; as properties, and store
	their property names in some globally-available place so that all graph algorithms could share them. However, this
	is almost the same thing as making them fundamental. So my compromise is to define another set of interfaces RawEdge/RawNode/RawGraph
	which implement the &quot;raw&quot; graph containment and connectivity, and then make Edge/Node/Graph extend these
	and extend PropertyContainer/UserObjectContainer and add these &quot;almost fundamental&quot; properties of nodes
	and edges.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>If [PropertyIndexSet/PropertyContainer] designed for efficiency [versus Hashtable], then where are benchmarks?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Preliminary benchmarks show a 1-4x performance improvement over Hashtable using an assortment of graph sizes
	and numbers of properties. It also occurred to me that PropertyIndexSet has an implicit &quot;garbage collection&quot;
	which Hashtables lack. See the documentation for more details. I believe that this optimization is justified; applications
	are slow enough as it is.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>getPropertyIndexSet: Integer array indexing is dangerous. Is there a better way?
</OL>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>Benchmarks should show the improvement over hashtables. If this is the case, then there is no better way that
		I can think of.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Edge</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Attach: should this throw an exception, instead of detaching automatically first? <ii>Reexamine: should edges
	attach() or should graphs attach()


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No longer a consideration under the new interface design.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>attach/detach: name? suggest: connect/disconnect


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No longer a consideration under the new interface design, but fixed in the actual underlying implementation.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>getHead(): Add &quot;Return null if not exist&quot; to Documentation


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Concurrency between threads: setHead/setTail requires to calls before edge is consistent


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>It has been decided that the graph package will not support concurrency. It is up to the user to provide concurrency
	support. This is a common practice in the recent Java code.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>attach/detach: redundant with setHead, setTail? Should this be in interface


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No longer a consideration under the new interface design.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Why is this an interface and not a class? (i.e. is more than one class actually going to implement this)


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No longer a consideration under the new interface design. The interfaces for graphs/nodes/edges are now read-only.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>What happens on setHead(Null)?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No longer a consideration under the new interface design.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Is it the responsibility of the low-level API to ensure consistency.


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No. The low- and high-level APIs are more distinct in the new interface design, and in fact it is now encouraged
	to always use the high-level APIs in all common package usage..</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Is clear() doing too much work?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No longer relevant in new interface design.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Further document what interface does in strange and possibly inconsistent calls
</OL>

<OL>
	<LI>add: edge is not checked for uniqueness


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No longer relevant in new interface design.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Should this be an interface or a class?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No longer relevant in new interface design.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Implement better policy in interface instead of relying on comments


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Greatly improved in new interface design. GraphModel implements a tight policy.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>getParent: no setParent... better name, add setParent?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>getParent() removed..</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>getParent: probably not needed


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>getParent() removed..</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>In and Out sets can get corrupted using Node/Edge interface: consistency checks? Exceptions? At least in class
	implementation?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>No longer visible to the user in the new API.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>What if edge is not in Set?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Don't understand.</FONT>..</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>CONSISTENCY CHECKS?????? Manual check? is this redundant? Leave Hooks?
</OL>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>GraphModel implementations can provide graph-checking routines, since it knows the underlying structure of the
		graph.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Graph</B>

<OL>
	<LI>add: spec seems over-complex. Should it simply require that the node be removed first? Advocate: consistency
	checks


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Under consideration...</FONT></P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>Should there be sub objects and strict hierarchy? answer:CompoundNode.


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#009900">Don't understand...</FONT></P>

	<LI>delete: see add.

	<LI>delete: name? Suggest: remove


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>clear: clarify, and see add


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>getNodeCount: should there be getEdgeCount? Edges don't seem to be fundamental to a graph? Can there be a symmetry
	between edges and nodes?
</OL>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>In a typical graph package there is no need for edges that cut across arbitrary graphs so it is easier to create
		a symmetry between edges and nodes. However, in this graph package &quot;containment&quot; and &quot;connectivity&quot;
		are more or less orthogonal, with nodes as the common point. So because an edge doesn't &quot;belong&quot; to a
		graph per se, I don't think that a symmetry is possible, nor am I convinced that it's particularly useful.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Node</B>

<OL>
	<LI>setParent():seems suspicious is this something that you really want to allow?
</OL>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>No longer visible to the user in the new API.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>GraphModel</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Add(2),add(3) -&gt; addNode and addEdge


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>addNode should default to the default graph?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Added extra addNode() method that does this.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>addSubModel/removeSubModel: Clarify description and improve name. Maybe some more description of how SubGraphModel
	works. @seealso


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>There is no longer a SubModel interface. GraphModel now contains a method getRoot() that returns the root model.
	Implementations can choose how this is implemented. In BasicGraphModel, there are two constructors, one for the
	top-most model and one for a sub-model; that's all the user needs to know.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>addSubModel expects implementation of GraphSubModel class


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>GraphSubModel has been removed. Now GraphModel knows about hierarchy. The root GraphModel has a <I>null</I>
	root reference.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>delete-&gt;removeNode, removeEdge


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>What are the canonical events that get generated? i.e. if node removed, then not only issue nodeRemoved, but
	also all the edgeRemoved.


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>I have chosen the following set of events: { edge_head_changed, edge_tail_changed, edge_data_changed, node_added,
	node_deleted, node_data_changed, structure_changed }. Though the edge_head_changed and edge_tail_changed might
	allow listeners to get into strange states, they are the minimal events necessary to implement a listener that
	can mirror the original graph. It is assumed that the end-user code that generated these events will either be
	through a &quot;safe&quot; API (a la GraphModel) or that it will be written with care. It is also not out of the
	question to write listeners which are careful about the events they receive.</P>
	<P>Alternately, I could have &quot;edge_added&quot; and &quot;edge_deleted&quot; methods, but this might initiate
	more work than is necessary on any particular</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>should get*PropertyIndexSet be in GraphModel or in graph? more description of propertyindexset or a @seealso


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Should be in GraphModel. If it's in Graph, it's too fine-grained and algorithms cannot leverage the hash-once
	efficiency.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>getRoot: more information or @seealso.


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#009900">Don't understand.</FONT></P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>getRoot: does this return root graph or root GraphModel? Or does this not really return a root and all and
	this should be called getGraph?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed. getRoot() now returns a pointer to the root GraphModel. getGraph() returns the model's graph.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>@SEEALSO!!


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#009900">Don't understand.</FONT></P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>setProperty-&gt;setEdgeProperty, setNodeProperty, setGraphProperty as well?


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>setUserObject-&gt;setEdgeUserObject,setNodeUserObject


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Fixed.</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<LI>SetUserObject: multiple users(algorithms)? I guess you can't.
</OL>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>No, and it doesn't make sense either. The UserObject semantics has been moved to a separate interface, where
		it explains in detail the semantics of the user object and why this doesn't make sense. Use the property mechanism
		for annotating the node with algorithm annotation..</P>

<P>There were more reviewers than customary because a number of people were new to design reviews. (In general,
three to five reviewers is optimum.) This is the first review with significant participation by both the Newton
and Lee research groups! It was great. One of the Ptolemy reviewers said that he was surprised and pleased at the
different perspective he got from the reviewers from the Newton group. -- johnr</P>
