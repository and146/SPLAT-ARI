<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>This design review seemed less productive than last time, but I think that was my fault for changing the class
	structure so much and not providing a clear list of changes (though it would have been quite large). Also the poor
	documentation on GraphModel and the lack of resolution on the event types was bad. But I have finished writing
	the interfaces and their implementations, and am nearly ready for a &quot;release&quot; of this low-level part
	of the package. All that remains is a little more documentation of how listeners should make use of the events,
	which is probably a short document in itself. Thank you all so much for your time and patience.

<H2><A NAME="identified"></A>Identified defects</H2>

<OL>
	<LI>Raw vs. cooked. Does the benefit of having separate graph, rawgraph, etc., justify the cost?
	<P>Apparently not, according to the reaction. The Raw interfaces have been removed and folded into the &quot;cooked&quot;
	ones.</P>
	<P>
	<LI><B>Edge</B>
	<OL>
		<LI>Is weight foundamental to the graph?
		<LI>Should there be a default value for weights?
		<LI>How about let the weight be a property instead of a member variable, so that the user can specify the type
		of the weight himself?
		<P>Weights have been removed from the graph interface.
	</OL>
	<P>
	<LI><B>Node</B>
	<OL>
		<LI>Clarify the behavior of remove in Iterator.
		<P>Done. (remove throws an exception)</P>
		<LI>When calling inEdges() and outEdges(), what happens if there are no edges?
		<P>Done. (a iterator with no elements is returned)</P>
		<LI>Clarify who sets visited false and when.
		<P>Done. (an algorithm should &quot;setVisited(false)&quot; before each pass.)
	</OL>
	<P>
	<LI><B>RawGraphModel</B>
	<OL>
		<LI>This class needs to be redocumented.
		<P>Done.
		<LI><I>addEdge</I> function
		<OL>
			<LI>What happens if the nodes are not in the graph?
			<P>The nodes are connected by the edge and an event is dispatched. This is now generally discussed in the class-level
			documentation.</P>
			<LI>If there's no concept of adding an edge to the graph, it does make sense to say addEdge. Maybe it should be
			named connectEdge?
			<P>Renamed.</P>
			<LI>The behavior of the method needs to be clarified.
			<P>Done.</P>
			<LI><I>addNode</I>(node, graph) function
			<OL>
				<LI>Needs more comments.
				<P>Done.
				<LI>What happens if the graph is not a subgraph of this model's graph?
				<P>Same issue as the &quot;addEdge&quot; issue above, and same response.
			</OL>
		</OL>
		<LI><I>dispatchOff</I>, <I>dispatchOn</I> functions
		<OL>
			<LI>Argument symmetry. dispatchOn takes in a graph as an argument, but dispatchOff doesn't.
			<P>
			<LI>Why does dispatchOff turn off everything? This seems kind of arbitrary.
			<P>I don't remember this point being raised, but doing anything more fine-grained would force additions to an already
			substantial interface.
		</OL>
		<LI>Need a policy for constructing graph hierarchy.
		<P>Graph hierarchy is not officially supported in release 1.</P>
		<LI>Should add a function, <I>setDispatchEnabled</I>.
		<P>Done.</P>
		<LI><I>getGraph</I> needs to be recommented.
		<P>Done.</P>
		<LI><I>getRoot</I> function
		<OL>
			<LI>Why is there not a <I>getParent</I> function.
			<LI>No one gets it.
			<P>This method has been removed from the interface, as it is not necessary for a client to know about. Also hierarchical
			graph models will not be supported in this release.
		</OL>
		<LI><I>removeEdge</I> function
		<OL>
			<LI>Is the name appropriate?
			<P>Renamed to disconnectEdge().
		</OL>
		<LI><I>removeNode</I> function
		<OL>
			<LI>What if the node to be removed is not in the graph?
			<P>See above.
		</OL>
		<LI>RawGraphModel interface seems to be quite heavyweight. Is it too much work for the user to implement all these
		functions?
		<P>I have eliminated a few methods by collapsing setNode/Edge/GraphProperty into setProperty(PropertyContainer).
	</OL>
	<P>
	<LI><B>GraphEvent</B>
	<OL>
		<LI>What's the policy for view to maintain state between edgeDisconnected and edgeConnected?
		<P>I have documented this in GraphListener.
		<LI>NODE_DELETED should be NODE_REMOVED.
		<P>Done.</P>
		<P>
	</OL>
	<LI><B>GraphListener</B>
	<OL>
		<LI>Currently UserObjectContainer generates GraphEvent. Should it generate UserObjectEvent to be consistent?
		<P>Yes it does. This is a generic capability, so UserObjectChangeEvent and UserObjectChangeListener have been added.
	</OL>
</OL>
