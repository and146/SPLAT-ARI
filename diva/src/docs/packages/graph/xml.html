<H1><I>diva.graph.model</I> XML file format</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>This document describes the XML file format that is used to save and load graph models (and eventually views)
in the Diva graph package. XML stands for the Extensible Markup Language, and is described in more detail at the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org">W3 consortium home page</A>. XML was chosen as a basis for describing graphs because
it is simple, regular, extensible, and has plenty of third-party tool support. We strongly prefer XML to serialized
Java objects, because the XML format is human-readable/editable, and is independent of the object version so that
a file saved in XML will always be compatible with the current version of the graph package.</P>
<P>There are two aspects to the XML graph format. The first is the document-type-definition file, <A HREF="graph.dtd"><I>graph.dtd</I></A>,
which defines the syntax for graph files and is not intended to be edited by the user. The second is the actual
graph file, which is created by the user or written out by a graph editor. It describes a particular instance of
a graph topology. The rest of this document is a translation of <I>graph.dtd</I> into English accompanied by examples.

	<TR>
		<TD VALIGN="TOP">Graph</TD>
		<TD WIDTH="415" VALIGN="TOP">Graph is the top-most element in the graph file.</TD>

	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD VALIGN="TOP">Node</TD>
		<TD WIDTH="415" VALIGN="TOP">A node element represents a Node instance in the graph data structure. It is identified using a unique identifier
			which may be referenced by an edge, later in the file.</TD>
		<TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Courier New, Courier">&lt;node id=&quot;foo&quot;/&gt;</FONT></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD VALIGN="TOP">Edge</TD>
		<TD WIDTH="415" VALIGN="TOP">An edge element represents an Edge instance in the graph data structure. It is identified by a unique identifier
			and paramaterized by an optional boolean value which specifies its directedness. It is also parameterized by a
			head and a tail identifiers, which must reference nodes defined earlier in the file.</TD>
		<TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Courier New, Courier">&lt;edge id=&quot;baz&quot; tail=&quot;foo&quot; head=&quot;bar&quot;
			directed=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</FONT></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD VALIGN="TOP">CompositeNode</TD>
		<TD WIDTH="415" VALIGN="TOP">Consistent with the graph data structure, a composite node is both a graph and a node. It has the same parameters
			as a node, but has contents like a graph.</TD>
		<TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Courier New, Courier">&lt;compositeNode id=&quot;bar&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/compositeNode&gt;</FONT></TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
<FONT SIZE="4"><I><B></B></I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><I><B>Note:</B> Graph elements are identified by strings.  For parsing efficiency an element
in the file must be defined prior to being references, so that we can perform a one-pass parse.</I></FONT>
<H2>An Example</H2>
<P>This example specifies a graph which contains a node <I>a</I> and a composite node <I>x</I>.  <I>X</I> contains
two nodes <I>b</I> and <I>c</I>.  There are directed edge <I>e1</I> from <I>c</I> to <I>b</I>, <I>e2</I> from <I>x</I>
to <I>a</I>, and <I>e3</I> from <I>b</I> to <I>a</I>.<BR>
</P>
<PRE>&lt;graph&gt;
&lt;node id=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;
&lt;compositeNode id=&quot;x&quot;&gt;
&lt;node id=&quot;b&quot;/&gt;
&lt;node id=&quot;c&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/compositeNode&gt;
&lt;edge id=&quot;e1&quot; tail=&quot;c&quot; head=&quot;b&quot; directed=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;edge id=&quot;e2&quot; tail=&quot;x&quot; head=&quot;a&quot; directed=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;edge id=&quot;e3&quot; tail=&quot;b&quot; head=&quot;a&quot; directed=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/graph&gt;</PRE>
<H2>Using the API</H2>
<P>The Java API to the Graph XML format consists of two classes. GraphParser parses a graph model from an XML file
(and a DTD, which it uses to verify that the XML is syntactically correct). GraphWriter writes a graph model to
a file. These are easy to use, and the snippet of Java code below shows how to use them to save and load files
respectively.
<H2>Issues</H2>
<P>There are two remaining issues in the design of the markup language, storage of view information and semantic
objects/properties for nodes and edges.</P>

<P>We would like to be able to store view information, such as graph layout or node shape. This may be stored in
a separate file, or as an annotation on top of the existing file format. We haven't settled on a design yet, so
it's not supported in the current version. However, this is an important feature and will be supported in the next
version.</P>

<P>The second issue is the support &quot;semantic objects&quot; or &quot;properties&quot; which are defined by
the user and hang off the node. This may be achieved by an optional ID reference, which refers to some other XML
object. This is less urgent to us than the layout issue, and we imagine that there's a &quot;standard&quot; solution
out there somewhere--we just haven't looked too hard yet.</P>

<P>If you have an opinion on either of these two issues and would like to <A HREF="mailto:diva@ic.eecs.berkeley.edu">share
it</A>, we'd love to hear from you.</P>
