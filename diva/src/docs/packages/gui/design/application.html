<h1>Applications and Documents</h1>

<!--/contents-->

<P> The following diagram illustrates the static structure of the
application framework. The central inferface is the Application, which
contains a set of Documents and a set of Actions.  The application displays
itself in an <a href="context.html">AppContext</a>.

<p> An application is a class that implements the Application
interface, and this package provides an abstract class that implements
some of this interface. For example, a graph editor would subclass
AbstractApplication as, say, GraphEditor. The application is the class
that contains the <b>main</b> method, and is responsible for creating
and initializing all other classes. In particular, it is responsible
for initializing the menubars to contain <i>all</i> menus and menu
entries (there are no default menus -- it might seem like a good
idea, but it isn't).

<p> Although the concrete Application subclasses are responsible
for creating the menus, there are a number of actions that are
shared by many application, which are provided for convenience in
the DefaultActions class. This class is a collection of factory methods
that create Swing Action objects, such as Open, Close, Save, and so on.

<p> Each Application contains a list of currently-open Documents, one
of which is designated as the <i>current</i> document. The 
<a href="documents.html">Document</a>
interface captures the abstraction of a document which can be opened,
editied, and (probably) written to the file system.  An application 
also contains a document factory, which is used to create new documents
a type expected by the application.
