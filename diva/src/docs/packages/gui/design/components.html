<p> JShadePane and JTreePane are similar components in concept to JTabbedPane 
in that they both organize a set of components that can be browsed.  JShadePane
bworks better than JTabbedPane for a narrow browser where not many tabs can
fit on one row.  JTreePane works better for components that need to organize
a large number of panels in a hierarchical fashion.

<p> JPanner is a component that attaches to a JViewport swing component.  It 
provides a mechanism to visualize and manipulate the viewport without using 
scrollbars.  The entire component contained by the viewport is scaled
down to be completely visible in the panner.  Clicking within the 
JPanner centers the viewport at that point on the component.

<p> JPseudoFrame is not a Frame at all, but a component that provides 
an improved mechanism for handling multiple document style interfaces.
It enables a JInternalFrame to be maximized in the manner exhibited by Windows
applications. By default, if you use a JDesktopPane and maximize
one of the internal frames, the internal frame becomes the size of
the desktop pane, but it still has a full title bar. Instead, what you 
want is for the contents of the internal frame to <i>replace</i> the
desktop pane, and to have the window iconify, minimize, and close
buttons appear on the right-hand end of the menu bar.  For an example of 
how to use this class, see the 
<a href="context.html#DesktopContext">diva.gui.DesktopContext</a> class.

<p> JStatusBar is a component that is intended to mimic the status bar
found at the bottom of an Applet.  It contains a JProgressBar and 
simple message.  A common use of this class is to provide Applet  
look and functionality in JFrame based user interfaces.

<p> The MenuCreator, MenuFactory and JContextMenu classes provide a 
nice mechanism for
implementing context menus on top of the Diva canvas.  A JContextMenu is 
easier to use than JPopupMenu and has a field that represents the source
object.  A MenuFactory creates instances of JContextMenu that can be 
displayed by a MenuCreator canvas interactor.

<p> FocusMouseListener is a simple component listener for keeping keyboard
focus on a component when it is clicked on.  This is useful for defining
keyboard actions on a canvas.
