<P> The following diagram illustrates the classes that combine to 
provide support for different kinds of documents.

<p> The key interface for dealing with documents is the (surprise, surprise!)
the Document interface.  This interface provides methods for querying
standard information about the document, such as whether or not it is writable
to persistent storage, whether or not the document is editable, and whether 
or not the document is "Dirty" in that changes have been made and not saved.
The implementor of the document is responsible for properly setting these
properties, and these properties should be respected by any implementation
of a <a href="storagepolicy.html">StoragePolicy</a>.

<p> Each document may or may not be representable in some kind of 
persistent form.  For most documents, such as text documents, 
this will consist of a <i>primary file</i>.  More complex
document classes may choose to store themselves in multiple files --
or far that matter, somewhere other than in files. The Document subclass
provides the right abstraction that allows us to open and close these
documents. In the future, this interface could be extended to allow
searching and indexing as well. A Document could also be associated with a 
URL to allow it to be loaded via HTTP, but this functionality has not
yet been implemented.

<p> Documents also provide methods that are called by the StoragePolicy in
order to open the document and initialize it from persistent form, 
to save the document's data persistently, and to close the document
(releasing any resources the document may have been using).  Note that
the document interface says nothing about the type of the data, or in what
form it is persistently stored.  Concrete subclasses of Document 
(or AbstractDocument) are responsible for that.  We tend to prefer XML
for document persistence, since it is easy to pass over networks, is 
human readable, and often easier to manage than object serialization.

<p> Many times documents are naturally seen as a sequence of pages.  This
abstraction is most useful for information that is partitioned, 
but always saved together.  The MultipageDocument, Page and BasicPage classes
provide some basic infrastructure for handling such documents.  Concrete
subclasses are still required to implement document persistence and
application interpretation, however.
