<P> A StoragePolicy captures the notion of <i>how</i> an application
deals with persistent storage.  This diagram shows the static structure
of storage policies.

<p> For example, suppose a user selects
the Close entry on a menu. The application typically needs to
check whether the document has been edited, and if so, it needs
to decide what to do about it. This logic is implemented by a storage policy.
In general, the storage policy is not responsible for turning a 
document into a file on the file system, the document does that.  The storage
policy is responsible, however, for ensuring that the document has a 
file to be saved to, that the user can't accidently close the file without
saving it, and so forth. 

<p> BasicStoragePolicy is just about the simplest possible implementation of
a storage policy.  It doesn't really do anything interesting, or useful.

<p> DefaultStoragePolicy is a more useful storage policy implementation for
applications that use files on the local file system.  
It contains two file choosers, one for saving files and
one for loading files.  The context of each file chooser is maintained over
the lifetime of the storage policy, so that you never start off in the same 
directory over and over again.  The open method uses the document factory of
the application to create a document for a given file, possibly allowing the
user to browse for the file if the application did not specify it.  The saveAs
method uses the save file chooser to choose a filename for the new file.
The save method saves the file if the document was already associated with a
file, or defers to saveAs if no document had previously been specified.  The
close method prevents the user from closing the file without saving, if the
document had been modified.  Unfortunately due to the design of JFileChooser, 
it is useless for browsing files specified using a URL.  We are looking
at ways of extending the StoragePolicy mechanism to include such documents.

<p> We are interested in writing more intelligent storage policies that are 
capable of operating with less interaction from the user.  (Do YOU like all
those stupid confirmation popups?)  One thing to try would be a storage
policy that always implicitly saves the current version of the document.  
It is likely that such a storage policy would be useful only with an 
infinite undo mechanism and some way of visualizing the current state of the
Document.
