<H1>BrushStroke Design Document</H1>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>This document describes two approaches to building a brush stroke rendering component for informal user interfaces.
The goal of brush strokes is to make vector graphics look hand-drawn, the idea being that this will make certain
types of vector graphics-based user interfaces more natural to use. The <I>diva.sketch.BrushStroke</I> class is
the implementation of this idea for Java2D.</P>

<H3>Stroke Interface</H3>
<P>In both approaches described in this document, BrushStroke implements the java.awt.Stroke interface. Stroke
is the way in which Java2D allows users to augment low-level vector rendering capabilities. A Stroke is an interface
which produces a &quot;stroked&quot; equivalent when given a wireframe object as input. For example, BasicStroke,
the default Java2D stroke implementation, allows the user to control things like the line width, dashes, rounded
vs. square vs. angled miters, etc.</P>

<P>The BrushStroke implementation allows the user to choose from &quot;brushes&quot; which allow for configuration
of the stroke’s look and feel. For example, one brush might create a stroke reminiscent of a felt-tip marker and
one might create a stroke resembling a stick of charcoal.</P>

<H3>Shape-Warping Approach</H3>
<P>The shape-warping approach is the one pictured above, where a brush’s shape is warped so that it surrounds the
perimeter of the input shape. This is accomplished by constructing a parametric mapping between the two shapes,
ranging from 0 to 1. This is illustrated intuitively in the figure below.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I>[figure: shape-warping approach]</I></FONT></P>
<P>The shape-warping implementation is given in the following pseudocode:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I>[pseudocode]</I></FONT></P>
<P>The shape-warping approach has a single but significant benefit, which is its simplicity. It is quite simple
for a user to create his own brush interactively, by editing a shape. Furthermore, the simple behavior of the stroking
algorithm is intuitive and predictable. The approach has two drawbacks, however. The first drawback is that the
stroke’s algorithmic consistency results in visual inconsistency, when applied to shapes of different path lengths,
because of the parametric mapping. This is best illustrated with a figure:</P>

	<TR>
		<TD WIDTH="100%"><IMG SRC="images/inconsistency.gif" WIDTH="351" HEIGHT="133" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD WIDTH="100%">
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>Inconsistency: top and bottom strokes use same brush but are rendered differently
			because they are different lengths.</B></FONT>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
</P>
</CENTER>
<P>The second drawback is that the algorithm is slow. Not intrinsically so, but slow under the constraints implied
by the java.awt.Shape interface. If the Shape interface had some sort of parametric measurement built into it,
the explicit first-pass calculation of the shape’s parameter values might be avoided, and the algorithm might be
sped up considerably. Since this is an inner-loop piece of rendering code, performance is of utmost importance.</P>
<H3>Caps-and-Repeater Approach</H3>
<P>The caps-and-repeater approach attempts to solve both problems that plague the shape-warping approach, and does
so at the cost of increased complexity. The basic idea is that rather than specify a single shape that is stretched
around the given shape, define a pair of head and tail &quot;caps&quot; which are pasted around a body shape which
is repeated. This is illustrated below:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I>[figure: caps-and-repeater]</I></FONT></P>
<P>This solves the distortion problem of shape-warping because the caps and repeater can be warped in logical coordinates
instead of parametric space. The algorithm can also be made single-pass for the same reason. The pseudocode (and
illustrative pictures) are shown below:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I>[pseudocode and images]</I></FONT></P>
<P>The downside of this algorithm is that it suffers from relative complexity. The specification of a body and
end-caps is not as straightforward as the specification of a single shape to be warped. Also the general approach
does not imply all aspects of the implementation and there is still some policy that needs to be set for these
cases. For example:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>What happens when the repeater is &quot;cut short&quot; on one of its repetitions; how does it merge smoothly
	with the end cap?
	<LI>What happens when the shape is not long enough to incorporate both caps?
</UL>

<P>In the implementation code complexity arises from various lookahead problems. For example, consider the drawing
of the end cap: the algorithm needs to start drawing the end cap before it actually finishes iterating over the
given shape, so it needs to maintain a buffer and look-ahead for this purpose.</P>
