<H1>Parser2D design document</H1>

<P>
This document covers the structure, algorithm, and implementation of
the Parser2D package, <i>diva.sketch.parser2d</i>, which provides
basic two-dimensional parsing based on graph grammars.  I advise a
thorough reading of the <a href="parser2dUser.html">Parser2D user
manual</a> beforehand for context.

<H2>Parsing algorithm</H2>

<P>
The current parsing algorithm implementation is more of a placeholder
than a long-term solution.  I wanted to get a prototype of the system
together quickly, and also wanted to see how the most naive algorithm
would actually do in practice.  In other words, though the algorithm
may be theoretically uninteresting, it's good enough for our purposes
if it runs in "real-time" for normal sized inputs.

<P>
The parser operates on sets of <b>constituents</b> which are
rectangular bounding boxes supplemented by a String <b>type</b> field.
It uses the spatial relation constraints specified by the grammar to
match structures, which in turn become <b>composite constituents</b>.
More specifically, it successively applies a set of rules to the input
constituent set, and if the rules match a subset of constituents, it
substitutes the left side of the rule (the rule's type) for the
matching constituents in the right side.  This forms a new
ConstituentSet (along with the remaining constituents) which is then
passed to the parser again.  This chain continues until there are no
rule matches.  If the constituent set at the end of the chain is a
successful parse (the definition of which might vary from application
to application--a <i>complete</i> parse, for example) this is returned
as part of the results.

<P>
Here is a complete execution tree for the following traditional grammar:

</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>
This algorithm is inefficient, but this can be mitigated through
use of memoization.  As you can see in the trace above, there are
two paths to get to the state <i>"var(a) var(b)"</i> and three
paths to get to <i>"var(a) expr(var(b))"</i>.  This number obviously
explodes as the problem size increases.  So the Parser2D object
maintains a hash table that memoizes the results of previous
parses.  The ConstituentSet class re-implements Java's <b>hashCode()</b>
and <b>equals()</b> methods for memoization.

<H2>Package structure</H2>

<P>
The Parser2D package is similar to Diva's Classification package,
<i>diva.sketch.classification</i>, in that it provides an algorithm
used by sketch recognition but is more generally applicable and hence
designed with no dependencies on any of the other sketch packages.

<P>
The basic structure of the package is given in the UML diagram below.
The main elements are the <b>Parser</b>, <b>Rules</b>, <b>ConstituentSet</b>,
<b>Constraints</b>, and <b>Relations</b>.  The parser is parameterized by
a set of rules which are used in the algorithm described in the previous
section.  The basic rule implementation provides a constraint query on the
input, by making more general queries on the constituent set and then
narrowing down the results.  The basic rule has a single constraint, which
is usually an <b>AndConstraint</b> if the rule is stated using the grammar.
The <b>BasicConstraint</b> object, the leaf of the constraint hierarchy,
has a minimum and maximum value that must be satisfied by a relation (distance,
size ratio, angle, overlap amount, etc.).

<P>
A constituent set is more than an array of constituents.  It also
consists of a set of spatial queries on the constituents, potentially
optimized so that these queries can be performed quickly (by using a
quad-tree, for example) without having to search the entire set of
constituents.

<H4>Relations</H2>

<P>
Relations calculate geometric/spatial relations between objects.  They
are used to determine the values that are used by rules in the
grammar.  The relation interface has a single method, <b>double
apply(Rectangle2D r1, Rectangle2D r2)</b>, which extracts a scalar
value that represents some aspect of the spatial relationship between
<b>r1</b> and <b>r2</b>, such as distance, overlap amount, etc.  A
directed relation is a relation in which the relationship is directed
from one rectangle to the other, and not reflexive.

<H2>Extensions</H2>

<P>
This section describes a set of potential extensions to the parser
in terms of the existing architecture.  Its intent is to encourage
critical thought of the architecture, to illustrate ways in which the
architecture is extensible, and finally to ellicit comment on the
proposed extensions, which are obviously still in the brainstorming
stage.

<H4>Optimization</H4>

<P>
As mentioned before, the existing parsing algorithm is a place-holder.
One desirable augmentation to the package is an optimization of the
existing parsing algorithm.  A proper redesign would require a literature
search and would not be trivial.  But a first step would be a "separation
of concerns" in which the building of the spatial relationship graph (which
is implicit--lazily constructed and never stored so it doesn't show up
as its own data structure--in the given design) is done as a pre-pass
to the parsing algorithm, which tries to match tree-structured rules on
the graph.

<P>
This enhancement would require creating a graph data structure and
writing a module that constructs this data structure conservatively
but does not produce a <i>complete</i> graph (in which every pair of
vertices is adjacent).  Rules would have to be rewritten to operate
on the graph data structure, and I'd probably want to rewrite the
parsing algorithm to make better use of the up-front knowledge of the
relation graph.

<H4>Fuzziness</H4>

<P>
In many recognition problems with noisy data you can never be 100% sure
of the values of the input tokens, so the recognizer will often output
a list of potential values with confidence values attached.  A fuzzy parser
would accept a TerminalConstituent that is agumented with a confidence value
between 0 and 1, and then propagate confidence values up the tree (using
laws of probability) as it aggregates constituents.  A better implementation
would also factor in the uncertainty of the inter-constituent relations
specified in the grammar.  So a grammar could actually be specified "by
example" and the aggregation would then be a classification problem that
uses relation values as its features.

<P>
These enhancements would require a number of changes to the existing
classes, but little change to the structure of the package.  The
Constituent interface would need to be augmented with a <b>double
getConfidence()</b> method, and this would need to be supplied by its
implementations.  Rules would need to be modified to use fuzzy
constraints that perform classification instead of the rigid
constraints that are currently supplied with the package.  Two new
classes, <b>FuzzyRule</b> (implements Rule) and
<b>RelationClassifier</b> (uses a set of Relation objects and feeds
the values into a <b>diva.sketch.classification.Classifier</b>), could
be added to the package.

<H4>Connection rules</H4>

<P>
One shortcoming of the package is that it is fundamentally
aggregational in nature, meaning that each rule aggregates its
contents into a more abstract entity.  However, <b>connections</b>
(edges between objects) represent a different type of structural
entity that is not really handled properly with aggregational
rules.  For example, consider the following diagram:

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR><TD>
<center>
<img src="images/connections.gif">
</center>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B>A diagram with edges that cannot be easily recognized using current rule set.</B></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>
I leave it as an exercise to the reader to determine the myriad of
ways that this will break the current parser.  What you'd really like
is to parse the aggregational aspect of the diagram using the current
parsing algorithm (<i>[G [N1 N2]]</i>) and augment this with a
set of connections between <i>referenced</i> elements in the aggregation
(<i>[[E1(directed) N1 N2] [E2(dashed, inheritance) N2 N3]]</i>).

<P>
Schneiderman [ref?] states that visual languages have three fundamental
features: containment, adjacency, and connectivity.  I think that
aggregational rules do a pretty good job of containment and adjacency,
but fail in connectivity.  Since connectivity is a fundamental feature
of many visual languages, it is not a hack to add orthogonal support for
this feature.

<P> A suggested alternative to adding this feature to the parser is to
layer connectivity as a post-processing step between the parser and
the application. 

<H4>Incrementality</H4>

<P>
The current parsing algorithm is not incremental, meaning that it parses
a complete constituent set and returns a result.  However this is probably
not an ideal design for sketch recognition, where the user is drawing
new strokes one-by-one.  In this case, the constituent set is modified to
include the latest stroke and this is re-parsed from scratch by the parser.

<P>
An incremental version of the parser would accept deltas in the form of
stroke additions (or removals?) and would re-parse more efficiently using
its existing parse tree and/or parse state (the chains of constituent
sets mentioned in the section on parsing algorithms).  I have yet to concretize
an algorithm for this, but structurally its effect on the package would be
the following:

<UL>
<LI><b>Parser2d</b> would need to be rewritten, replaced, or subclassed
to support an additional user method
<b>public List addConstituent(TerminalConstituent c)</b> and perhaps one or more
private methods that allow changes to propagate through a recursive traversal
of the parse state.
<LI><b>ConstituentSet</b> might similarly need to be rewritten, replaced, or subclassed
to allow for additional state information and pointers to its predecessor / successor parse states.
</UL>
