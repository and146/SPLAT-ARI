<H1>Parser2D user manual</H1>

<P>

This document gives a user-level description of the Parser2D package,
<i>diva.sketch.parser2d</i>, which provides basic two-dimensional
parsing based on graph grammars.  I start with an overview of the
package for context, and follow with a comprehensive description of
the grammar format.  Finally I describe how the parser is integrated
into the flow of a sketch-recognition program and give a source code
example to illustrate things more concretely.  For information about
the design of the package structure and parsing algorithm, please see
the <a href="parser2dDesign.html">Parser2D design document</a>.

<H2>Overview</H2>

The Parser2D package provides basic two-dimensional parsing for
structural recognition.  Traditional string parsing is a special case
of two-dimensional parsing, where tokens are related to each other
only by <i>adjacency</i>.  In this two-dimensional parser, tokens are
related to each other by more complex relations, such as <i>overlap
amount (containment, adjacency, intersection), distance, angle,
relative size</i>, etc.

<P>
The two-dimensional parser was written for the purpose of recognizing
structure in sketched drawings.  The parser can just as easily be used
for non-sketched diagrammatic interfaces (such as visual languages),
but in this document we explain the package in terms of sketch
recognition since I expect most users will be more interested in this
application.

<P>
The following image depicts a user's sketch that can be recognized as
a scroll-pane (a pane that is controlled by a vertical scrollbar)
using the parser in conjunction with a sketch recognizer.  It is used
as an example throughout the rest of this document.

<H2>Grammar</H2>

<P>
The grammar parameterizes the parser with a set of rules that
are matched on the input tokens.  It is written in XML (see
<a href="http://www.xml.org/">http://www.xml.org</a> for more
info).

<P>
The following is a sample grammar that specifies a rule for the
vertical scrollbar example in terms of spatial constraints between a
vertical rectangle boundary, an upward triangle up-arrow, a downward
triangle down-arrow, and a square handle.  It then specifies a pane as
a horizontal rectangle, vertical rectangle, or square.  Finally it
composes the vertical scrollbar and pane into a scroll pane as
pictured in the previous section. The complete sample grammar for a
set of GUI widgets is <a href="widgets.g2d">here</a>, and the document
type definition (DTD) is <a href="grammar2d.dtd">here</a>.

<P>
Like most context-free grammars for one-dimensional string languages,
the 2D grammar specified here consists of a set of productions, each
of which has a left side and a right side.  However the way these
productions are specified differs somewhat from a standard grammar
format, such as Yacc or Bison, because of the two-dimensional nature of
the input.

<P>
The <b>rule</b> element contains a <b>type</b> field that is
equivalent to the left side of the production.  The contents of the
rule are the right side: a <b>root</b> object and a set of
<b>relative</b> objects which are spatially related to the root object
under a system of constraints.

<P>
For the scrollbar object specified above, the root object is the
boundary of the scrollbar and the relatives are the up-arrow,
down-arrow, and handle.  The choice of root is somewhat arbitrary,
except that the spatial constraints relate relatives to the root
<i>only</i>, and <i>not to each other</i>.  This restriction makes
the relations tree-structured, which greatly simplifies the parsing
algorithm.  For the simple examples I've considered (sketching of
GUIs and mathematical equations) this restriction does not overly
constrain the user.

<P>
Interpreting the scrollbar example:

<UL>

<LI>
The first distance constraint states that the NORTH site of the
up-arrow must be within 20 pixels of the NORTH site of the boundary
rectangle, but there is no minimum distance. The down-arrow is
similarly constraint to the SOUTH of the boundary rectangle.  And the
CENTER square is constrained to be close to the CENTER of the boundary
rectangle.

<LI>
All relative objects are
constrained to be CONTAINED by the boundary rectangle.  CONTAINED is
short-hand for specifying that 90% or more of the area overlaps.  This
can be fine-tuned using <b>min</b> and <b>max</b> fields.

<LI>
All relative objects are constrainted to be between <b>.5</b> and
<b>1.1</b> times the width and less than <b>.3</b> times the height of
the bounding rectangle.  There is no minimum value of the height
ratio, because a vertical scrollbar can be arbitrarily tall, while the
height of its arrows and handle will probably remain approximately
constant.

</UL>

<P>
So in fact, based on this interpretation, we see that the parser actually
accepts many different scrollbars, some of which may look only vaguely
scrollbar-like (such as the case where the up-arrow is 1.1 times the width
of the boundary).  That is the cost of using conservative constraints.

<H3>Constraints</H4>

The constraints specified in the grammar fall into four orthogonal
flavors: distance, angle, overlap, and size.  This table summarizes
the different constraints and their parameters.  All constraints have
<B>min</b> and <b>max</b> fields to specify the minimum and maximum
values of the constraint.  These are required for the distance and
width/height/areaRatio constraints and are optional for angle and
overlap, which have more abstract ways to specify the relationship for
convenience.

<P> Angle and distance constraints rely on the concept of
<b>sites</b>.  A site is a point on the bounding box on the object,
one of either: NORTH-WEST, NORTH, NORTH-EAST, EAST, SOUTH-EAST, SOUTH,
SOUTH-WEST, WEST, or CENTER.  For relations that use sites, the
default values if they are left unspecified is CENTER.

<H2>Parser usage</H2>

<P>

This section describes the actual code usage of Parser2D.  The
classes of interest at the user-level are <b>Parser2D</b>,
<b>ConstituentSet</b>, and the <b>Constituent</b> interface and
its implementors.

<P>

<b>Parser2D</b> is the class that performs the parsing.  It is
constructed with a grammar file as its argument.  The <b>parse()</b>
method is the user's primary interface to the parsing functionality of
the package.  It accepts a <b>constituent set</b> as its argument and
returns a list of constituent sets (all possible interpretations) as
its result.

<P>
A constituent is either "terminal" or "composite".  A <b>terminal
constituent</b> is the two-dimensional equivalent of a "token" in
traditional parsing.  It consists of a rectangular <b>bounding box</b>
and a string <b>type</b> field.  A composite constituent is a set of
constituents, which has the bounding box of the union of its
children's bounding box and a type derived from the grammar.

<P>
For the scrollpane example, the parser's input is a set of terminal constituents
(whose bounding boxes are abbrieviated by "..."):

<PRE>
ConstituentSet[
   Terminal[square ...]
   Terminal[vrect ...]
   Terminal[upTri ...]
   Terminal[downTri ...]
   Terminal[square ...]
]
</PRE>

and its output is:

<PRE>
List[
   ConstituentSet[
      Composite[ scrollpane :
         Composite[ pane : Terminal[square ...] ...]
         Composite[ vscroll :
            Terminal[vrect ...] Terminal[upTri ...]
            Terminal[downTri ...] Terminal[square ...]
	    ...
         ]
	 ...
      ]
   ]
]
</PRE>



<H2>Code example</H2>

<P>
Here we illustrate the usage with a sketch example, but a different
application (such as a non-sketch-based visual language) could simply
supply a different constituent set based on its own diagram
representations.  Parser2D is integrated into the sketch package in
the following way:

<OL>

<LI> Users sketch individual strokes in the form of diagram elements
(squares, circles, letters), mathematical elements (integral sign, division bar), or
handwritten characters.

<LI> These strokes are recognized as symbols with types by a low-level recognizer.

<LI> The 2D parser (parameterized by a user-specified grammar)
recognizes structures in the drawing, such as mathematical equations
or diagrams.

<LI> An application receives the parsed results and can perform
semantic analysis or processing based on the structure.

</OL>

<P>
The following code segment implements a version of this flow by
reading in a training file (for recognizing the individual strokes), a
grammar file (for 2D parsing), and a user's input sketch.  It is
included here for a concise snapshot of the interaction between the
low-level recognizer and the parser.
