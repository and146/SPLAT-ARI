<UL>
	<LI>It is unclear what advantages the threading feature in PipelineLLR provides.
	<P>Threading allows for slow, compute-intensive LLR implementations. For some algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors
	(which compares an input gesture with every training gestures), classification may be slow if the training set
	is large. Also in the case where multiple LLRs are used. If this is running in the same thread as the UI, the user
	will experience a delay which is undesirable in interactive applications.</P>
	<P>The user has the option of putting the LLR in its own thread.</P>
	<LI>Change events seem inadequate for updating views of the gesture.
	<P>Noted. This is being updated to specific events corresponding to the start, modification, and completion of
	a stroke.<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"></FONT></P>
	<LI>The name &quot;pipeline&quot; [in PipelinedLLR] is misleading. It leads one to believe that the implementation
	is itself pipelined.
	<P>This class is no longer present after redesign.<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"></FONT></P>
	<LI>Might one want to use multiple low-level recognizers? If so, how can that be implemented in the architecture?
	<P>It is possible to write an aggregate LLR (say a voting scheme) given the current architecture. One can write
	a class which implements LowLevelRecognizer and the class would contain several recognition engines, each of which
	can also implement LowLevelRecognizer. If the class uses a voting scheme for classification, it would collect the
	classification results from each of the individual recognition engine, and produces a final result.</P>
	<LI>What exactly is a command &quot;type&quot; ? Simply using a string seems like it may be insufficient.
	<P>Types are now more sophisticated to reflect this criticism. The basic type class has a string representation,
	but subclasses can have more sophisticated fields, i.e. an EdgeType might have the head and tail nodes as part
	of the classification.<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"></FONT></P>
	<LI>Parallel listening of HLR and the PLLR in order to do progressive recognition seems to have synchronization
	problems.
	<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The &quot;HLR&quot; (now called ClassificationRecognizer) now listens to the PLLR (now
	called GestureRecognizer).</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Interfaces</B></FONT></P>
<P><B><I>Gesture</I></B></P>

<UL>
	<LI>removeAllStrokes() seems unnecessary
	<P>Moved from interface to implementation.</P>
	<LI>strokeCount() should be renamed getStrokeCount()
	<P>Fixed.</P>
	<LI>Why does gesture have a type rather than a classification?
	<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Under consideration.</FONT></P>
	<LI>The use of the term &quot;gesture&quot; is inconsistent of that of the general community. Normally, &quot;gesture&quot;
	refers to a command derived from a stroke.
	<P>We like the term gesture, but to eliminate any confusion we will change the name to StrokeSet.</P>
	<LI>It doesn't seem right for gestures to be annotated with properties by the application. Instead, consider that
	commands or classifications should be annotated with the gestures they were derived from.
	<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Under consideration.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><B><I>LowLevelRecognizer</I></B></P>

<UL>
	<LI>train doesn't seem to belong in the interface. Perhaps provide a separate &quot;Trainable&quot; interface?
	<P>Good point. Fixed.</P>
	<LI>The wrong exception type is thrown in train.
	<P>Fixed.
</UL>

<P><B><I>Stroke</I></B></P>

<UL>
	<LI>The name &quot;Stroke&quot; is taken by the AWT. &quot;BasicStroke&quot; is taken as well.
	<P>Stroke is the most intuitive name for what this object represents: a stroke drawn by a pen. And since they are
	in a package, we don't think it is a big issue. But we will try to think of another descriptive name.</P>
	<LI>Do strokes really need a general property annotation mechanism?
	<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Under consideration.</FONT> The property annotation mechanism is currently used for allowing
	reusable computation on strokes.</P>
	<LI>clear() is not needed.
	<P>Moved from interface to implementation.
	<LI>pointCount() should be renamed getPointCount().
	<P>Fixed.
	<LI>path() should be renamed points(). The documentation should indicate the type of objects in the returned iterator.
	Stoke is an interface, but the intended return type is BasicStroke.TimedPoint, a class.. This seems fishy.
	<P>Fixed. We will make TimedPoint a full-fledged class.</P>
	<LI>Suggestion: look at awt.GeneralPath to see how they deal with paths.
	<P>We've looked at this class and it doesn't seem like this is consistent with the rest of the Iterators in the
	JDK. TimedPoints should make this cleaner.</P>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Classes</B></FONT></P>
<P><B><I>CommandFilter</I></B></P>

<UL>
	<LI>commands() should be renamed commandNames().
	<P>Fixed.
</UL>

<P><B>GestureAssembler</B></P>

<UL>
	<LI>_timeoutPeriod should be private
	<P>Fixed.</P>
	<LI>What is the default value of _timeoutPeriod? (answer: 3 ms)
	<P>Documented.</P>
	<LI>removeGestureListeners() and removeChangeListeners() are not necessary.
	<P>Fixed.
</UL>

<P><B><I>PipelinedLLR</I></B></P>

<UL>
	<LI>The threading model is unclear. How does it work, and what good is it?
	<P>Fixed. Threaded operation has been removed from PipelinedLLR, and a subclass, ThreadedPipelinedLLR has been
	created which operates in its own thread. See above for an explanation of why threading is potentially useful.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Concluding comments:</STRONG>

<UL>
	<LI>John thought more complete UML diagrams would've been helpful.
	<LI>Shaz thought the design review was very instructive.
	<LI>Jason wanted to see some examples of applications that would use this package. Prof. Landay's group has some
	stuff at: <A HREF="http://guir.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/satin">http://guir.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/satin</A>.
