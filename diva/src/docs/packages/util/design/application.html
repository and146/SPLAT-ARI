<h1>Applications and Documents</h1>

<P> The following diagram illustrates the static structure of the
application framework. The central inferface is the Application, which
contains a set of Documents and a set of Actions.  The application displays
itself in an <a href="context.html">AppContext</a>.

<p> An application is a class that implements the Application
interface, and this package provides an abstract class that implements
some of this interface. For example, a graph editor would subclass
AbstractApplication as, say, GraphEditor. The application is the class
that contains the <b>main</b> method, and is responsible for creating
and initializing all other classes. In particular, it is responsible
for initializing the menubars to contain <i>all</i> menus and menu
entries (there are no default menus -- it might seem like a good
idea, but it isn't).

<p> Although the concrete Application subclasses are responsible
for creating the menus, there are a number of actions that are
shared by many application, which are provided for convenience in
the DefaultActions class. This class is a collection of factory methods
that create Swing Action objects, such as Open, Close, Save, and so on.

<p> Each Application contains a list of currently-open Documents, one
of which is designated as the <i>current</i> document. The Document
interface captures the abstraction of a document which can be opened,
editied, and (probably) written to the file system. Each document may
or may not contain a <i>primary file</i>, which is what you would
think of for simple documents such as text documents.  (More complex
document classes may choose to store themselves in multiple files --
or far that matter, somewhere other than in files.) The Document subclass
provides the right abstraction that allows us to open and close these
documents. In the future, this interface could be extended to allow
searching and indexing as well.
