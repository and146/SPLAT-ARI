<P> The following diagram illustrates the components that the diva.gui.toolbox
package provides.

<p> JShadePane and JTreePane are similar components in concept to JTabbedPane 
in that they both organize a set of components that can be browsed.  JShadePane
works better than JTabbedPane for a narrow browser where not many tabs can
fit on one row.  JTreePane works better for components that need to organize
a large number of panels in a hierarchical fashion.

<p> JPanner is a component that attaches to a JViewport swing component.  It 
provides a nicer way to pan across the viewport by clicking within the 
JPanner to center the view at that point.

<p> JPseudoFrame is a component that provides an improved mechanism for
handling multiple document style interfaces.  It is intended to be used with
the swing JDesktopPane class to implement frame maximization properly.

<p> JStatusBar contains a JProgressBar and simple message, similar to what
is found at the bottom of an Applet.  It can be used to provide a similar
look and functionality in JFrame based user interfaces.

<p> MenuCreator, MenuFactory and JContextMenu provide a nice mechanism for
implementing context menus on top of the Diva canvas.  A JContextMenu is 
easier to use than JPopupMenu and has a field that represents the source
object.  A MenuFactory creates instances of JContextMenu that can be 
displayed by a MenuCreator canvas interactor.

<p> FocusMouseListener is a simple component listener for keeping keyboard
focus on a component when it is clicked on.  This is useful for defining
keyboard actions on a canvas.
