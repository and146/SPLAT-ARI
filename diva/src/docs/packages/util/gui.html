<H1>Gui utilities</H1>

<P><B>diva.util.gui</B> is a small, simple application framework,
designed to make it easier to construct useful Swing applications. It
should also be possible to extend this framework to create a more
elaborate to better suit your own particular application.

<P> The following diagram illustrates the static structure of the
application framework. The GUI components are shown in the lower
left. The main component is ApplicationFrame, which is a frame that
contains several other components laid out in a standard fashion: a
menu bar, tool bar, a palette (on the left), a status bar, and the
main display component. This layout is commonly used by drawing tools,
such as Visio.

<p> The classes JPalette and JStatusBar are not part of Swing, but are
provided as components in the diva.util.gui package.

<p> An application is a class that implements the Application
interface, and this package provides an abstract class that implements
some of this interface. For example, a graph editor would subclass
AbstractApplication as, say, GraphEditor. The application is the class
that contains the <b>main</b> method, and is responsible for creating
and initializing all other classes. In particular, it is responsible
for initializing the menubars to contain <i>all</i> menus and menu
entries (there are no default menus -- it might seem loike a good
idea, but it isn't).

<p> Although the concrete Application subclasses are responsible
for creating the menus, there are a number of actions that are
shared by many application, which are provided for convenience in
the Action class. This class is a collection of Swing Action objects,
such as Open, Close, Save, and so on.

<p> Each Application contains a list of currently-open Documents, one
of which is designated as the <i>current</i> document. The Document
interface captures the abstraction of a document which can be opened,
editied, and (probably) written to the file system. Each document may
or may not contain a <i>primary file</i>, which is what you would
think of for simple documents such as text documents.  (More complex
document classes may choose to store themselves in multiple files --
or far that matter, somewhere other than in files.) The Document subclass
provides the right abstraction that allows us to open and close these
documents. In the future, this interface could be extended to allow
searching and indexing as well.
