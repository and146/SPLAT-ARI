<H1>Jester</H1>

<P><B>Jester</B> small package for writing test suites for Java
classes. This package is designed to make it easy to write unit test
suites and test suites for object collaborations. In particular, it
encourages the use of factory classes for creating
objects-under-test. Consistent use of factories:

<OL>
	<LI>Enables test suites for abstract classes and interfaces to be written.
	<LI>Enables tests to be run over instances of a subtree of classes, provided that classes conform to the &quot;inheritance
	is extension&quot; principle of OO design.
</OL>

<P>In the near future, this page will be updated with a more detailed description of Jester and examples of how
to use it.
