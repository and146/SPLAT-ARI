<H1>Diva Whiteboard Overview</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>The whiteboard package contains several classes which implement a digital whiteboard application.  The whiteboard
application is built within the diva.gui framework and uses the diva.sketch package to provide the sketch-based
user interface.  If you want to build your own sketch-based application quickly within this whiteboard framework,
you can simply instantiate your own sketch controller and interpreter in Whiteboard.java.</P>

<P>The whiteboard application has the following features:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>multiple documents each of which could have multiple pages
	<LI>save and load documents in xml format (we use sml for file extension.  It stands for sketch markup language)
	<LI>export to jpeg
	<LI>change pen color and width
	<LI>navigate pages
	<LI>basic command gesture support (check for selection and scribble for deletion)
	<LI>move and resize sketched figures
	<LI>freeform sketching
</UL>

<P>
<H2>Architecture Overview</H2>
<P>The following is a UML diagram of the whiteboard architecture.  The classes with gray background belong to the
diva.gui package, and the classes with slash pattern background belong to the diva.sketch package.</P>

<P>A whiteboard contains multiple sketch documents each of which is associated with a frame.  A document may contain
multiple pages and the current viewing page needs to be displayed in the frame.  Referring to the UML diagram,
each sketch document is associated with a JSketch which knows how to display the document.  More specifically,
a page in the document is associated with a sketch pane which is used to view the sketch model contained in the
page.  When a page is selected for viewing, JSketch swaps in the pane that displays the page.</P>

<P>The whiteboard supports a few command gestures.  The way it works is that strokes that are drawn with the right
mouse button pressed will be interpreted by a command interpreter whereas strokes drawn with left mouse button
pressed will not.  Therefore users can sketch free forms with the left button and perform command gestures with
the right button.  A command interpreter receives mouse events as the user sketches on the canvas.  It filters
out the events that are performed with the left mouse button and only processes the events <FONT COLOR="#000000">that
are performed with the right mouse button.  The command interpreter uses a gesture recognizer to recognize geometric
shapes.  If the recognizer anaylizes a stroke to be a &quot;check&quot; or a &quot;scribble&quot;, the command
interpreter will ask the controller to execute the corresponding actions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The whiteboard also supports parsing and loading of documents.  The followiing is a UML
diagram that illustrates this framework.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A DocumentParser can be used to parse all pages of a multi-page document from a file.
 It uses a model parser to parse the content of a page.  This assumes that every page is associated with an application
model.  In the case of whiteboard, each page contains a sketch model and the document parser uses a sketch parser
to parse each page.  To see how this works, let's look at a short example:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This is a sketch document in xml format.  It contains only one page and the page content
is shown in green.  The document parser would parse this file into a document data structure, and it would ask
the sketch parser to parse the page content (green section) generating a sketch model for the page.  Similar a
DocumentWriter uses a model writer to write out multi-page documents.  In the above example, the document writer
would write the text in purple and for each page, it would use a sketch writer to write out the model in the page
(green section).</FONT></P>
