<H1>Whiteboard design history</H1>
<P><A HREF="#figure1">Figure 1</A> is a UML diagram depicting our first attempt at whiteboard architectural design.
The application contains three main components, a controller (a toolbar and a recognition engine), a whiteboard
model and a view on the model. In a very high level sense, the controller generates actions which modifies the
model. The model notifies the view that the data structure has been changed, and the view updates to reflect the
most recent state of the model. This is a typical model/view/controller design pattern. In the case of the whiteboard
application, there are two elements that modify the data structure. One is the toolbar which produces editing actions
such as add page and remove page, and the actions update the model accordingly. Another one is the recognition
process which takes in sketch inputs and generates gestures. Each gesture is wrapped by a symbol and added to the
model. A symbol contains information that's relevant for displaying the gesture, such as color, linewidth, and
shape. The defect of this design is that it is not clear how multiple windows can be supported for a single document.
We felt a need to refine this architecture in order to handle that issue.</P>
<P><A HREF="#figure2">Figure 2</A> is the second take on the design of the whiteboard architure. In order to support
multiple users sharing the whiteboard, the current page information cannot be kept in the document (whiteboard
model). The reason is that the users may be sharing the same document, but they can be viewing different pages.
If the document keeps a current page, that means all the users have to view the same page. This is clearly undesirable.
Another approach is to let the document keep track of the view and the page it's viewing. However this is a bad
design and very unextensible. The document should not know about the view or anything else. Its only purpose is
to store the document data structure. In order to maintain a clean interface between the document (whiteboard model)
and its renderer (whiteboard canvas), it is better not to keep the current page information within the document.
Without knowing the current page, the document cannot handle page switchings. Therefore CurrentPageModel is introduced
to keep track of the current page and to handle page switched events. This also solves the problem of multiple
users viewing different pages of the same document. The users share the same whiteboard document, but each has
his own CurrentPageModel. The flow of the events are as follows: the user invokes an action via the toolbar. The
action modifies both the document (whiteboard model) and the current page model. The document will generate document
events (page added and page removed) and send them to document listeners. In this case, the document has CurrentPageModels,
each of which is from a different user, as its listeners. Everything else in the application listens to its current
page model for page updates. When a current page model receives document events, it passes them on to its listeners.
This way, we simplify the event communication among modules. The modules that are interested in document events
and/or page switched events can register themselves as listeners to the current page model.</P>
<P>Also in the second architecture, we clarified the interaction between the document and its view. A document
contains multiple pages, each of which contains a sketch model. In this case, a page contains a sketch model representing
the sketch on the page. Similarly, a whiteboard canvas is a view on the document. It contains multiple page panes,
each of which views a page. And a page pane simply contains a sketch pane that views the sketch model embedded
in the page. Each sketch pane receives user sketch inputs in the form of mouse events and sends them to the recognition
engine. We treat the recognition engine as a black box here. Its responsibility is to consume mouse events and
produce classification events based on its recognition of the gesture. The SketchProcessor processes the classification
events and modifies the sketch model accordingly. In the whiteboard application, the recognizer produces empty
classification events and the sketch processer simply produces a symbol for each gesture drawn and adds the symbol
to the sketch model. In this version of the architecture, the entire application shares a recognition engine and
a sketch processor, which means that we cannot easily have a page that understands graphs and another page that
understands some other kind of drawing.</P>
<P><A HREF="#figure3">Figure 3</A> displays the third revision, which simplifies the architecture significantly
and also makes it more powerful. A page now contains an object which represents an application-specific model (i.e.
sketch model, graph model, etc.). And the document canvas contains panes for viewing the models. Each type of model
is viewed with an application-specific pane and the pane is generated <I>lazily</I>, meaning it is created only
when the page needs to be displayed. We use a model renderer to create the panes; the model renderer creates a
pane that knows how to display a given model based on the model's type.&nbsp; This is done using Java's reflection
capabilities.&nbsp; Another major architectural change is that now each pane has its own reconition engine and
sketch processor. This allows each page to be interpreted differently. For example, one page can recognize graphs
while another page can recognize JavaTime component diagrams. <BR>
