This is a demonstration application for the Diva canvas.  This
application servces two purposes: first, it illustrates capabilities
of the Diva canvas. This it does by creating a set of windows that
show various functionality that can be achieved with the canvas. Some
of these are "hard-wired" and can you can examine the code to
determine how to achieve the same results, while some are loaded from
XML files.

<P> Which brings us to the second point, which is that this
application is also a simple demonstration of how to use the
diva.gui application framework. The comments in the source
code files (and the javadoc) are therefore oriented towards
explaining the use of diva.gui.
