/** Geometry is an interface that captures the concept of an

 * Geometry objects generally provide support for reshaping and
 * querying geometry-related aspects of figures and shapes.
 * Generally, Geometry objects will contains some number of
 * Site objects as part of this support.
 *
 * <p>This interface is fairly "loose," because there are
 * so many different ways that figures might choose to allow
 * access to their geometry. It is not intended to be rigid
 * framework-style interface that defines what implementors
 * should do, but merely to provide a way to loosely group
 * the geometry classes together.
