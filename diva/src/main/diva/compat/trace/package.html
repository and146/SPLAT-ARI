Visualization surfaces for "railroad" diagrams. These
surfaces all implement the client-side tuple-set protocol,
and display data along a series of straight lines. The
kinds of visualization that can be created with these
surfaces include Gantt Charts, protocol
diagrams, sequence diagrams (as in UML), and so on.
