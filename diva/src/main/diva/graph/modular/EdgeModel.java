/**
 * An edge is an object that is contained by a graph and connects
 * nodes.  An edge has a "head" and a "tail" as if it was directed,
 * but also has a method isDirected() that says whether or not the
 * edge should be treated as directed (e.g. should there be an arrow
 * drawn on the head).  An edge has a semantic object that is its
 * semantic equivalent in the application and may have a visual object
 * which is its syntactic representation in the user interface.
