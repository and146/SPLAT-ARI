<P>The <b>diva.graphx</b> package provides extensible and interactive viewing
of graph data structures. The name stands for "graph e<i>x</i>tension," by which
we mean that the package is designed to be used with your existing
graph data structure to make it visible and editable. Your graph
data structure does not have to be modified to be used this way.

<p>
To be able to read and manipulate your graph structure, the package
requires that you implement two interfaces, NodeModel and EdgeModel.
Each of these is an adapter (perhaps we should have named them
that way) to nodes or edges of your graph. For example, EdgeModel
has method such as
<pre>
java.lang.Object getHead(java.lang.Object edge);
java.lang.Object getTail(java.lang.Object edge);
boolean isDirected(java.lang.Object edge);
</pre>

By implementing this interface, you provide diva.graphx with enough
access to your graph structure to read and manipulate it. You will
notice that the argument types above are all Object, so we are losing
some type-safety in trade for this flexibility.

<P>
To draw your graph in a canvas pane, diva.graphx needs you to also
implement the interfaces NodeRenderer and EdgeRenderer. Each of these
has a method that takes a node or edge object as argument, constructs
a diva.canvas.Figure, and returns it. diva.graphx will add this figure
to the canvas, and place or route it appropriately.

<p>
The key strength of diva.graphx is thus its ability to allow you to
quickly construct an interactive, MVC-architecture, editing pane for
your graphs.  More complex editors can be built on top of this
functionality if desired. For simple applications, diva.graphx
provides a simple attributed graph data structure that can be used.

<P>
Graphs can also be constructed programmatically. Here
is an example of  instantiating a simple graph with two
nodes connected by an edge (<FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"> A -&gt;
B </FONT>).</P>
