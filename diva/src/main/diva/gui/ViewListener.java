/**
 * A listener interface for receiving events on views. A _view_ is any
 * JComponent that contains a view into a Document. Typically, views
 * might be opened, closed, iconified, and so on. Although there are
 * various listeners in AWT and Swing that capture these events, they
 * are all specific to certain widgets, whereas the ViewListener
 * interface abtracts from specific widgets.
 *
 * <p> This interface is partly based on the Swing InternalFrameListener
 * interface.
