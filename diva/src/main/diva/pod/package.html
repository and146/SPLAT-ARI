A Pod, in Diva, is an object that contains a "pile of data."  This is
our term for complex data structures that evolve with time. Pods
communicate with each other to form even more complex evolving data
structures. For the background ideas from which this package sprang,
see the <a
href="http://www.gigascale.org/diva/about/papers/thanksgiving.html">"Thanksgiving
Whitepaper"</a>.

<p> The data in a Pod is typed, in a coarse sense. We refer to the
"type" of data as a <i>protocol</i>. We have identified the following
protocols, which we believe cover almost all of the kinds of data that
you are ever likely to want to generate, store, view, and manipulate:

<ul>
<li> Graph. A graph-structured Pod contains an attributed graph.
Nodes of the graph are connected by edges. Optionally, nodes of
the graph can contain ports, which can also be connected by edges.

<p>
We allow a simple form of hierarchy between graphs, but more complex
forms of hierarchy are implemented by connecting Pods.

<p>
<li> Tree. Although a tree can be viewed as a degenerate graph, it
is sufficiently common to warrant its own protocol.

<p>
<li> Multivariate data. That is, tuples of data, where each slot in
a tuple is named.

<p>
<li> Visual layout. Data that represents a visual graphic. All views
of data from Pods are done using the visual layout protocol.

</ul>

<p>
The data in a Pod can either be generated internally by the Pod, or
come from an external source -- for example, a web crawler, a
running simulation, or a visual editing program. A Pod that
does not receive data, but only generates it, is called a Generator.
By themselves, Pods cannot display data in any way, instead relying
on Views to display data.

<p> Pods communicate using Transmitters, Channels, and Receivers. The
analogy should be obvious -- except that only a single Channel can be
connected to any Transmitter or Receiver. For data to be communicated
between two Pods, or between a Pod and a View, some external agent
needs to set up the appropriate Channels between these objects. The
structure of a system containing multiple Pods and Views can be
arbitrarily complex. For example, the Smalltalk Model-View-Controller
can be implemented by creating a single Pod, and multiple Views with
two channels in either direction between the Pos and each
View. (Actually, it's more complex than this, because we have to allow
for Layout Pods, which are implicit in most descriptions of MVC. In a
non-trivial MVC-style editor, the equivalent of a Layout Pod is
required anyway, and significantly complicates the design. By making
Layout Pods explicit and reusable, we expect a Pod-based editor to
actually be simpler than the equivalent MVC one!)

<p>
However, much more than MVC is possible with Pods. For one thing,
Pods can receive data from other Pods, and transmute it into
a different protocol. Viewers (as opposed to editors) are much
simpler to construct than using an MVC-based toolkit. By identifying
the key protocols needed for data modeling and visualization, we
increase possibilities for reuse -- code is written based around
a well-defined protocol, rather than an application need and an
ill-formed notion of the structure of the data therein.

<p>
In other words, we think Pods are the greatest thing since sliced
bread.
