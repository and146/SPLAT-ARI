<P> This package implements feature extraction including Rubine's list
of features given in [1].  Feature extraction means calculating a
particular scalar characteristic (e.g. aspect ratio) of a
stroke.  AreaRatioFE, CornerFE, and SumOfAbsDeltaRatioFE are features
that we added on top of Rubine's features.  </P>
