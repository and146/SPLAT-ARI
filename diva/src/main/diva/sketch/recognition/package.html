Utilities for doing single-stroke and multi-stroke recognition.  A stroke is a sequence of data points captured from pen-down to pen-up.  <i>TimedStroke</i> is the data structure for storing information pertaining to a stroke.  Classes with <i>Stroke</i> in their names are single-stroke related, and classes with <i>Scene</i> in the names are multi-stroke related.  For example, <i>BasicStrokeRecognizer</i> performed recognition on single strokes, while <i>SceneRecognizer</i> performed incremental 2D parsing on a scene database containing multiple strokes.
