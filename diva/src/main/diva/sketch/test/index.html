Some regression tests for the Diva sketch package:
<ul>

<li> Load a sketch, save it, and compare the files to make sure they
       are identical.  Tests saving, loading, and the integrity of the
       sketch model.

<li> With a predefined stroke, or set of strokes, measure a set of
	features and verify their correctness (for deterministic
	features, e.g. most things except for # of corners).  write a
	test of the feature extractors to make sure that they produce
	the correct set of features for the test strokes.

<li> Record a set of mouse events.  Instantiate a sketch window, but
	don't show it.  Send the mouse events to the window.  Check
	that the model contains the correct stroke.

<li> Given a classifier/stroke recognizer, run it on a stroke and make
	sure that the output only contains valid types and confidences.

<li> Instantiate whiteboard, change line color and width, send
	pre-recorded mouse events, change to an editing state,
	send more events, save to file, and compare to test
	file.

</ul>
