A package of utility classes. These classes may be used
by any package in Diva. The classes are grouped into:

<ul>

<li> Property support. A small set of classes design to
"cache hash-tables" for more efficient access.

<li> Miscellenaous clases. Typically convenience classes
and classes that "should" be in the JDK.

</ul>
