The archive file jasper-combined.jar is a replacement for two 
archive files from the original distribution: jasper-runtime.jar 
and jasper-compiler.jar.  Since these contained at least one class 
in common (org.apache.jasper.compiler.Localizer) they caused problems
elsewhere in the build system.  The combined archive is the union
of the two original ones.
