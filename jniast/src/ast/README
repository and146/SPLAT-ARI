This directory should contain the file 

    ast_source.tar

from the AST source distribution; it can typically be found in 
/stardev/sources/ast.  It is not currently provided under CVS control 
because it is effectively a large binary.  But it could be if
we're not worried about that.

------------

I've added the ast_source.tar file to the CVS archive, since copies of
AST V2.0 are out there now and there is too much possibility for 
confusion otherwise.  So copying ast_source.tar by hand is no longer
necessary.

------------

Modified the way this is done to be more compatible with CVS/autotools
build of AST.  This directory now contains the requisite AST source
files copied from the version of AST that this JNIAST corresponds to.
The ast_source.tar file is removed.
