Provides an interface to the Starlink
<a href="http://star-www.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun211.htx/sun211.html">AST</a>
library.

<h2>AST library vs. <tt>uk.ac.starlink.ast</tt> package</h2>

The classes and methods here provide, via classes comprising native code
which calls the underlying AST library, a complete interface to AST V1.8-3.
The following sections discuss differences between the AST library
and this interface to it.

<h3>Class hierarchy</h3>
The class hierarchy of the AST library is exactly replicated in this
package, though this package contains some additional classes and
interfaces used in the implementation which are not subclasses of
<code>AstObject</code>.  The classes are named the same, but without the
'Ast' prefix, except for <code>AstObject</code>, as a convenience to 
prevent a clash with <code>java.lang.Object</code> 
<i>(should the same apply to <code>Frame</code> to prevent a clash 
with <code>java.awt.Frame</code>?)</i>

<h3>Methods</h3>
The methods are named the same as in the AST library except without
the 'Ast' prefix. 
In almost all classes there is a one-to-one correspondence between
AST functions and methods in this package (though see the list below
for omissions).  In a few cases extra
methods are provided here as conveniences.
In particular, specific getter/setter methods are provided for each
attribute of AstObject and all its subclasses.
The generic <code>set</code> and <code>set&lt;type&gt;</code> 
methods may be used to set attributes, but using the specific methods
provides better type safety.

<h3>Method arguments</h3>
Method arguments broadly follow their specifications in the AST library,
but there are differences:  
<ul>
<li><code>boolean</code>, rather than <code>int</code> type is 
    used for integer arguments/return values with boolean intent,
<li>on the whole pointers are eschewed in favour of return values 
    to provide the results of a call,
<li>callbacks are implemented using specially defined classes or 
    interfaces
<li>where a method must be able to indicate an error condition
    communicating this via return value is eschewed in favour of 
    raising an exception.
<li>in some cases, the length of an array argument is not required,
    since unlike in C, this is implicit in the passed array itself
</ul>
Thus for instance:
<pre>
   void astTran1( AstMapping *this, int npoint, const double xin[], 
                  int forward, double xout[] )
</pre>
becomes
<pre>
   public double[] tran1( int npoint, double[] xin, boolean forward )
</pre>
(<code>this</code> is implicit,
<code>forward</code> is of type
boolean rather than int, and 
<code>xout</code> is the return value rather than a pre-allocated array
into which the result can be written),
and
<pre>
   int astGQch( float *chv, float *chh )
</pre>
becomes
<pre>
   public float[] qch() throws Exception
</pre>
(failure is indicated by throwing an Exception rather than by a zero 
return value, and the result is a returned array consisting of the two 
calculated values, rather than writing new values into locations
pointed to by the arguments).

<p>It is therefore recommended that programming is done with reference
to the documentation of this package rather than of SUN/211.
However, because of the strict type-checking of java compilers,
it is unlikely that misconceptions about method signatures arising
from familiarity with the C or Fortran versions of AST will result
in compilable but incorrect code.

<p>Where an array argument needs to be of a certain length
the native code checks that it is at least of that length.
If it is not, an exception is thrown to that effect.
However, supplying an array which is longer than required in such
cases is not regarded as an error.

<h3>Symbolic constants</h3>
Relevant AST symbolic constants are made available 
by public static final fields of
the same name in the class to which they are relevant.  These are
guaranteed to have the same value as their AST library counterparts
(the implementation obtains them at runtime using the definitions in
the "ast.h" header file).
Access is also available by name using the <code>AstObject</code>'s 
<code>getAstConstant&lt;type&gt;</code> methods, though this is
intended mainly for use within this package, and somewhat deprecated
for user code.  Thus the <code>FrameSet</code> class contains the
declaration:
<pre>
   public static final int AST__CURRENT = getAstCurrentI( "AST__CURRENT" );
</pre>

<h3>API documentation</h3>
API Documentation has largely been generated by extracting comments
wholesale from the AST source code and turning it into doc comments,
which have then been processed by javadoc in the usual way.
Although comments about a given argument ought to apply to the
the correct argument, some of the language will be incorrect 
(e.g. 'pointer' where it should say 'reference'), 
and some comments will be irrelevant or possibly misleading.
In the future, some (actually, quite a lot of) work will be 
required if the comments are to read like they were written for java.

<h3>Error conditions</h3>
Errors are handled in a robust way using Exceptions.  If any call in 
the underlying AST library sets the AST Status to a non-zero value,
this will be indicated to the calling java code by the throwing
of an {@link uk.ac.starlink.ast.AstException}.
AstException provides a <code>getStatus</code> method
(and defines the corresponding status values) so that the
exact nature of the error which caused the trouble can be 
determined if desired.  In a few cases, the java or native code
will throw an AstException not generated by the AST library too;
in this case the status will have the value AstException.SAI__ERROR.
AstException extends {@link java.lang.RuntimeException}, 
so that declaring and catching
such throwables is not enforced by the compiler.
Efforts have been made to ensure that Exceptions will be thrown 
in all cases rather than causing a JVM crash, but the JNI is 
a bit tricky in some circumstances, and there may be cases 
I haven't thought of.  Please report JVM crashes (which will
almost certainly be a result of JNI code in this package rather
than an error in the JVM as they tend to report).

<h3>Synchronization</h3>
All calls to the underlying AST library itself
(though not to the various methods of the classes which form this package)
are effectively synchronized - a lock is obtained on an object
maintained by the JNI code for this purpose.
This implementation detail is required so that AST calls from 
different threads do not interfere with each other, by overwriting
one or two C globals.  In most cases this should not be noticeable, 
but it may have response time implications for multithreaded applications
which invoke the the few time-consuming AST calls such as 
the <code>resample&lt;type&gt;</code> methods of <code>Mapping</code>.


<h3>Unimplemented functions</h3>
Here is a list of the AST functions which 
are not implemented because they are not 
appropriate in a Java context in one way or another:

<h2>Tolerance of absent native code</h2>

Being substantially an interface to native code, this package breaks
java's platform independence.  Client code may wish to invoke the
package in such a way that it can tolerate being used on a platform
where the native code (shared library) is not available.
Of course the JNIAST functionality will be lost, but if that is not
a fundamental part of the client code's functionality, it may be better
to do this than to throw a fatal error.  This can make it possible to
run (albeit with reduced functionality) on a wider range of platforms
than would otherwise be possible.

<p>To do this, code can use the 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.ast.AstPackage#isAvailable} method,
which indicates whether the requisite native code is available for use.
If it is, then AST processing can take place as usual, but if not
then as long as code avoids attempting to create or dereference 
any instance of <tt>AstObject</tt> or its subclasses it should run 
without errors <small>(I think)</small>.  Attempting to create or dereference 
an <tt>AstObject</tt> when <tt>AstPackage.isAvailable</tt> returns
<tt>false</tt> will normally result in a {@link java.lang.LinkageError}
of some sort.

<h2>Package status</h2>

This package is a temporary measure; in due course it will be superceded
by the pure java WCS package.  WCS is being actively worked on now (mid 2002),
but the timescale for completion is uncertain.
