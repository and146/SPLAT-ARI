#     26-NOV-2002 (MBT):
#        Now strips leading -L from ADDLIBS elements.
#     20-DEC-2005 (MBT):
#        Use EMS not MERS.
#     21-DEC-2005 (MBT):
#        Use Conly flags on hds_link and ems_link to remove fortran
#        dependency altogether.

#  $STARLINK/lib or /star/lib. Decided against LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#  as this contains things like "/usr/lib" which we don't want to pick
#  up any libraries from.
