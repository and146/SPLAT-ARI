2002-08-11  Version 2.0

	* Refactored catalog classes to be more flexible and allow for
	  different URL and data formats (*** Incompatible Change ***).
	  Replaced most of the classes in the "jsky.catalog.skycat"
	  package with more generic versions under jsky.catalog.

	* Added a new catalog package: "jsky.catalog.astrocat", which is
	  based on a new XML format that can replace or be used along with
	  the previously used Skycat catalog config file (skycat.cfg).
	  The default list of available catalogs is now by default in the
	  resource file resources/conf/AstroCat.xml (see the comments in
	  resources/AstroCat.dtd for more information).
	  
	* Added support for the ISRA catalogs and image servers (see
	  http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/).

	* Added Performance improvements for displaying FITS image files.  New
	  JDK1.4 features (memory mapped buffers) are now used to speed up
	  image display for large images. 

	* Changed the way image tiles are cached for FITS files. The new
	  version uses the JAI tile cache and should be more efficient
	  with memory. 
	
	* Note: JSky now requires JDK-1.4.0_01 and JAI-1.1.1_01, since
	  earlier JDK versions contain bugs that caused the application to
	  run out of memory! 

	* Added special support for zooming out FITS images. In the
	  previous version, large images had to be read in completely and
	  then scaled down. Now the scaling is done while reading in the
	  image using memory mapped buffers.

	* Changed the source directory structure. Java classes are now under
	  ./src, resources are under ./resources.

	* Merged in changes from Sandy Grosvenor (GSFC) in the
	  jsky.science, jsky.util, and jsky.util.gui packages. The changes
	  include a new RangeSlider class (renamed previous RangeSlider
	  class to VRangeSlider), some javadoc improvements, bug fixes,
	  and a few new classes.

	* Reformatted all java source files using IntelliJ Idea, to get a uniform
	  indentation and tab width.

	* Changed the font used for printing tables (class PrintableJTable) to be
	  smaller, to save space.

2002-02-28  Version 1.3
	
	* Tested with jdk1.4 (The source release contains a patched version of
	  diva.jar that works with jdk1.4).

	* Started internationalizing some of the user interface classes.
	  There are now some new package subdirectories named i18n that
	  contain property files with names like gui.properties, or
	  gui_<locale>.properties.  These will eventually contain foreign
	  language support. If you are interested in contributing
	  translations, please send email to abrighton@gemini.edu.
	
	* Added the jsky.image.BasicImageReadableProcessor interface,
	  which is now used by a number of image related classes (provided
	  by Frank Tanner of STScI).

	* Added support for Java based catalogs (contributed by Guillaume Helle). 
	  A Java based catalog can be referenced in the catalog config file by 
	  a URL of the form java://<className>?<arg1>&<arg2>&...&<argn>. The given 
	  class should implement the jsky.catalog.Catalog interface.
	  See jsky.catalog.skycat/TestCatalog.java for an example of usage.

	* Added support for proxy servers in the catalog window.

	* Upgraded to the latest JFreeChart version (0.7.3).
	
	* Various bug fixes and code improvements.  
	
2001-12-18  Version 1.2

	* Changed widgets to conform more to the standard Java look and
	  feel guidelines described in
	  http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed2/book/index.html.

	* Catalog classes: minor changes and bug fixes. Added a new method
	  to the Catalog interface: "boolean setQueryRegionFromImage()",
	  which can be used to stop the GUI from setting the query region
	  from the image automatically.

	* Fixed a number format bug in the "Select Area..." feature of the
	  catalog window.

	* Added support for local command catalogs under Windows (previously
	  this only worked on UNIX systems).

	* Catalog table display: added a tab to the Configure window where
	  you can select which table columns to display or hide. The
	  settings are remembered on a per catalog basis between sessions.

	* Changed the label on the catalog window "Go" button to "Query".

	* Added a catalog window menu item to toggle the visibility of the
	  catalog tree subwindow (upper left). The setting is remembered
	  between sessions.

2001-10-22  Version 1.1

	* Added an entry for the 2mass catalog to the default catalog
	  config file (accessed via CDS) and added code to avoid an error
	  message that you get when the query result is empty and does not
	  contain a valid header.
	
	* The catalog browser now displays the copyright information for
	  catalogs, if available (copyright field in catalog config file).

	* Bug fix: Local catalogs are now searched in a background thread
	  like remote catalogs, since the user may enter an object name
	  that needs to be resolved by a name server, which could cause
	  the application to hang if not done in a background thread.
	  
	* Fixed a bug where catalog symbols could end up using the
	  composite selected for a graphics object.

	* Added the jsky.catalog.gui.TableSelectionListenexr and related
	  classes and code changes provided by Daniella Malin.

	* Fixed some problems that showed up when displaying color images,
	  such as JPEG (The pan window was not being updated correctly).

	* Fixed problems displaying image and graphics when the image is
	  flipped (ImageProcessor.setFlipX/Y).

	* Replaced the H-Compress sources under jsky/ca/nrc/cadc with a
	  jar file hcompress.jar, which is also available from
	  http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/software/hcompress/ (change in
	  conf/config.sh.in).

	* Changed the ImageDisplay, ImageZoom, ImagePanner, and
	  PickObjects classes to use composition instead of
	  inheritance. Previously protected members are now private, and
	  some new accessor methods were added.

	* Removed the jsky.catalog.astrores package and the dependence on the
	  XML jar file xerces.jar. Also removed some astrores related fields
	  from the FieldDesc interface (UCD, format, unit). 

	* Updated the Diva jar file to diva-0.3.

	* Fixed a bug in the display of the current pixel value in the bottom panel.
	  

2001-05-19  Version 1.0
	
	* Implemented the histogram equalization color scaling algorithm
	  and enabled the button for it in the Colors popup window.

	* The Colors popup window now displays the current colormap and
	  color scale settings.

	* Various changes in the jsky.image package to improve performance
	  when setting image cut levels.

	* Fixed a problem where the "Stop" button in the progress dialog
	  for a catalog query did not always stop the background thread.

	* Selecting a catalog from the catalog tree no longer starts the
	  query automatically (selecting it from the catalog menu in the
	  image window does though).

	* Added tool tips to a number of widgets.

	* Added popup menus to the catalog tree and table displays.  The
	  new catalog tree menu allows you to copy and paste catalogs
	  between catalog directories as well as change the order in which
	  the catalogs are listed. Only the top level catalog list is
	  editable.

	* Added a new "Pick Objects" feature and menu item under the
	  Catalogs menu. This pops up a window with a small zoom image
	  that helps you locate an object (star, galaxy) in the main
	  image. When you click in the main image, a centroid algorithm
	  locates the center of the selected object, displays statistics
	  about it, and optionally adds the information to a catalog
	  table.

2001-04-04  Version 0.24
	
	* Moved to JAI-1.1 (from JAI-1.0.2).  Note that this means you
	  need to install the new JAI version. If you use the CLASSPATH
	  install variant, make sure to modify conf/config.sh to include
	  JAI in the class path and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the JAI
	  lib directory (on UNIX systems).
	
	* Added an arrow button in the upper right corner of the image
	  window to toggle the visibility of the pan and zoom windows (Now
	  you can hide the pan/zoom frame so that it doesn't block part of
	  the image).

	* Fixed a bug that caused the image history menu and cache to not
	  be restored correctly and changed the suffix used for image files
	  in the cache (~/.jsky/cache) to use .fits for FITS files, etc.

	* Added support for ContentType=text/plain as the result of a
	  query (needed for the Simbad "More Info" links). The text is
	  displayed in the same way as HTML results in a popup window.

	* Added a new class NamedCoordinates that combines an object name
	  and the associated coordinates.

	* Changed the package name for the CADC hcompress package back to
	  the original ca.nrc.cadc.arch.io.

2001-02-15  Version 0.23
	
	* Fixed a bug plotting catalog symbols for images with other than a
	  J2000 equinox

	* Minor bug fixes for replotting previously plotted catalogs

	* Added method to get the center coordinates of the catalog symbol
	  at the mouse position (class SkycatTablePlotter).
	
2001-02-15  Version 0.22
	
	* New feature: Graphics menu item: "Save Graphics with Image", 
	  saves any drawings made via the graphics menu to a FITS binary 
	  table in the image. The graphics are then reloaded automatically
	  whenever the image is reloaded.

	* Now you can delete a selected FITS extension/HDU (except not the
	  primary extension).

	* Now that FITS images can be edited (add/delete HDUs), there is also
	  a popup dialog that asks if the modified image should be changed
	  before switching to a new image.

	* Changed the layout of the catalog window so that you can see the
	  query parameters and results at the same time.

	* Local catalogs can now also be searched in the same way as remote
	  catalogs (same as skycat).

	* Replaced the status bar (StatusPanel) at bottom of the image and
	  catalog windows with a popup progress window (ProgressPanel)
	  and simplified the handling of background tasks, fixing a
	  number of bugs along the way.

	* Catalog queries are now started automatically (you don't have to
	  push the "Go" button.

	* Added a tiled background image to the desktop when using
	  internal frames.

	* New catalog window menu item: "Save with image".  Now you can
	  save catalog tables as binary FITS tables along with the
	  image. The symbol plotting information is also saved, so that
	  when you reload the image latter on, the catalog symbols are
	  automatically plotted. (This is compatible with the same feature
	  in Skycat.)

	* JSkyCay now displays the version number in the frame header.

	* Fixed a bug in printing multi-page catalog tables, where only the
	  first page printed.

	* Various bug fixes.
	
2001-01-09  Version 0.21

	* Fixed a bug in the "New Window" menu item when using internal
	  frames.

	* Upgraded nom.tam.fits package to the latest version (jar files
	  included in release again now)

	* Added NASA/GSFC JSky sources (in jsky.science and
	  jsky.util). These were taken from the SEA/VTT source tree.

	* Added a new package defining a TimeLine widget: jsky.timeline.
	  This is a slightly modified version of the the SEA/VTT TimeLine
	  class.

	* Replaced the Java-1.x based Graph package with JFreeChart, which
	  is based on Swing widgets (See the README file for the URL).

	* Added a new widget: jsky.util.gui.RangeScale, which is a
	  modified version of a VisAD widget by the same name, used for
	  editing a range of values, such as low and high cut levels.

	* Changed the image cut levels window to use the new JFreeChart
	  package and replaced the two sliders with the new RangeScale
	  widget. Since the new graph display is Swing based, the cut
	  levels window now also works with internal frames.

	* Added new items to the Graphics "Fill" and "Outline" menus to
	  specify no fill or outline.

	* Added a "Composite" submenu to the Graphics menu, for changing
	  the transparency of graphics items.

	* Removed the dependency on TclJava/Jacl package, which was used
	  to deal with Tcl style lists and to evaluate plot symbol
	  expressions based on table column values - for performance
	  reasons. Now the jsky.util.TclUtil class has been rewritten to
	  handle Tcl lists in a faster and more simple way (we don't need
	  the complete Tcl parsing functionality here).  Expressions are
	  now handled by a new class and package (see below).
	
	* Added a new class jsky.util.JavaExpr, which is based on the JEL
	  (Java Expression Language) package. The new class is used to
	  evaluate dynamic java expressions at runtime. The expressions
	  are specified in the catalog config file (skycat.cfg) or in the
	  window interface (see the Configure button) and may contain
	  variables, which are the column heading names for a catalog
	  table.  For backward compatibility with the skycat config file
	  syntax, variables may still be specified as "$colName", however
	  now the syntax is Java based, so just "colName" will also
	  work. Tcl and Java expression syntax are fairly similar, so in
	  most cases there will be no difference between the old skycat
	  config entries and the new ones, however the new syntax is Java
	  based. The expressions are compiled to Java byte codes on the
	  fly and evaluated with different values for each line in a
	  catalog table.

	* Reimplemented the catalog symbol plotting code to remove the
	  dependence on the Diva package. Using specialized drawing
	  methods instead of the more general Diva figures improved the
	  performance greatly, especially for large tables, where
	  thousands of symbols need to be drawn.

2000-09-15  Version 0.19

	* Added a new class: jsky.image.graphics.ShapeUtil, with utility
	  methods for creating various shapes for drawing, including
	  support for drawing arrows.

	* Added a rectangle to the zoom window (jsky.image.gui.ImageZoom)
	  to show the center pixel.

	* Added a compass symbol to the pan window (jsky.image.gui.ImagePan)
	  to show WCS north and east.

	* Changed the direction of the X axis for blank images in
	  WCSTransform to have east at left.

	* Added a "WCS measure band" feature to measure world coordinate
	  distances in the image window (drag mouse button 2 or 3,
	  pressing shift or control changes the display).

	* The zoom window now also works while the mouse button is pressed.

	* Added a check for images without WCS support in
	  DivaMainImageDisplay.loadCachedImage().

	* Added support for B1950 equinox when searching catalogs and
	  changed the text box to a menu containing J2000 and
	  B1950. Currently, all coordinates are displayed in J2000,
	  although you can enter them also in B1950. An option may be
	  added later to set the equinox for display.

	* Changed the text in the image history menu (Go menu) to include
	  the file name, object name and center position, and added a
	  menu item to clear the history.

	* Made the catalog history menu persistent (like the image history
	  menu), so that the most commonly used catalogs are accessible
	  from the Go menu.  The image and catalog history information is
	  saved to a file under ~/.jsky (or c:/windows/.jsky) when the
	  application exits (only implemented for jdk1.3 or later).

	* Added bounds checks in jsky.coords.WCSTransform.

	* Added a comment column to the window displaying the FITS keywords.
	  Now there are 3 columns: keyword, value, and comment.

	* Added the jsky.util.gui.TableUtil class, with utility methods for
	  dealing with JTables and moved the JTable related methods from
	  jsky.util.JavaUtil to the new class.

	* Added support for displaying FITS tables as catalogs.

	* Added code to display the FITS header for the selected HDU. If the
	  FITS header window is open when you click on a line in the FITS
	  extensions popup window, the header for that extension will be
	  displayed.

	* Added the jsky.util.QuickSort class (from the OT sources).

	* Added catalog window menu item: "Delete Selected Rows".

	* Added a "Graphics" menu to the image display window, with entries
	  for drawing figures.
	

2000-08-28  Version 0.18

	* Split the jsky.util.HMS class into HMS and DMS classes (for
	  hours:min:sec and deg:min:sec).

	* Replaced the use of jsky.util.Format with java.text.NumberFormat
	  (for formatting numbers) and deleted the Format class.

	* Fixed a bug in the transformation of graphics objects, such as
	  catalog symbols (The symbols were not being translated and
	  scaled correctly, since the AffineTransform object was not
	  always up to date).

2000-08-27  Version 0.17

	* Improvements in the handling of blank images (with WCS support,
	  for catalog plotting)

	* Big performance improvements for sorting tables by clicking on a
	  given column heading (in class JSortedTable).

	* Added a "Configure..." button to the catalog table display window
	  and a new GUI for configuring the plot symbols for catalogs.
	  The changes are saved in ~/.jsky/skycat.cfg, in the same format
	  as the skycat config file.

	* Added support for saving user preferences, by default under
	  ~/.jsky.  Now the window positions and sizes are saved and
	  restored, as well as the image color and cut level settings (on
	  a per image basis). The toolbar options are also saved and
	  restored.  Most of the work is handled by the
	  jsky.util.Preferences class.

	* In jsky.image.ImageProcessor: removed all calls to update().
	  Now you need to call ImageProcessor.update() after changing any
	  of the ImageProcessor settings (NOTE: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE).  The
	  change was necessary for performance reasons, to avoid unneeded
	  calls to update.

	* Fixed table/plot symbol selection bugs with sorted tables (table sorting
	  was not taken into account when selecting the plot symbols).

2000-08-09  Version 0.16

	* Fixed a problem displaying numbers in catalog tables with jdk1.3
	  (went back to default table renderer for numbers).

	* Added support for popup menus in the GenericToolBar class.

2000-08-03  Version 0.15

	* Fixed problems with interrupting background threads

	* For JSkyCat: changed the default to use internal frames under Windows.
	
	* Added support for loading H-Compressed images (based on sources
	  provided by Patrick Dowler <Patrick.Dowler@nrc.ca> of the CADC.
	  (Reading of gzipped FITS files is also supported by the Fits I/O
	  library being used). Note that saving of compressed images is not
	  supported yet.
	  
	* Fixed a colormap calculation bug that caused FITS images to look
	  much darker and duller than they should.
	
	* Fixed a bug in the display of the pixel values in the status panel 
	  (the Y-axis was inverted for FITS files).

	* Added code to select the correct row in a catalog table when the
	  plot symbol is selected and to scroll the table to make the row
	  visible, if needed, and added code to select the correct symbol
	  when a table row is selected.

	* Added history items to the image and catalog window "Go" menus,
	  to return to a previously viewed image, catalog, table, etc.

	* Added code to send HTML pages to netscape, if it is running, and
	  otherwise use a Java based HTML viewer.

2000-07-24  Version 0.13

	* Added support for saving and printing images and catalog tables
	  as well as sorting catalog tables by column (all based on
	  modified versions of NASA SEA/VTT classes).

	* Added a catalog menu for the image and catalog windows, which is
	  generated based on the catalog config file (like the Skycat
	  Data-Servers menu).

	* Implemented the "Select Image Area" button in the catalog window
	  and automatically default to using the settings from the current
	  image.

	* Included a copy of the skycat.cfg catalog config file in the
	  jsky.catalog.skycat package and changed the fallback default
	  from the ESO web version to this local one. You can override
	  this by passing -Djsky.catalog.skycat.config=$(SKYCAT_CONFIG) to
	  java at startup.

	* Tested under JDK1.3 and fixed some JTable related problems that
	  turned up.

	* Switched from the IBM XML4J to the Apache Xerces XML library and
	  updated the jsky.catalog.astrores classes to use the new SAX2 API.

	* Ported the Gemini Observing Tool (OT) to use Swing and JSky
	  widgets.  A first version of this package (jsky.app.ot) is also
	  available from the JSky ftp repository
	  (See ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/archive/jsky/ot/README.html).

2000-06-02  Version 0.12

	* Changed the release tar file to include the class files,
	  documentation and required jar files, for convenience.

	* Added support for groups of graphic items, which are selected as
	  one item
	
	* Added support for master/slave graphic items, where dragging one
	  item also drags the others, but, unlike groups, they are not
	  selected as one object

	* Added support for "listeners" on graphic objects, so you can be
	  notified whenever an object is selected, moved or resized

2000-05-26  Version 0.11 

	* Implemented support for Skycat style catalogs and symbol
	  plotting.

	* Added graphics support (based on the Diva package) for drawing
	  on the image canvas, plotting symbols, etc.

	* Added a number of interfaces for image display: BasicImageDisplay,
	  GraphicsImageDisplay, MainImageDisplay, for coordinate conversion:
	  CoordinateConverter, WorldCoordinateConverter, and for graphics:
	  CanvasGraphics.

	* Added a "navigator" package that combines the image display and
	  catalog browsing features.

	* Changed the jskycat application class to be based on the navigator 
	  classes.

	* Update the jsky/bin/jskycat script (assumes that you put the jar files
	  in jsky/lib).
	  
	* Removed the sources for these external packages: nom.tam.fits, graph.
	  Now you just include the necessary jar files in the classpath in the
	  master makefile. The JSky ftp dir contains a tar file (jars.tar.gz)
	  with all of the necessary jar files.

	* Moved the WCSTransform class from GOV.* to jsky.coords and changed it
	  to implement the new WorldCoordinateConverter interface.

	* Changed the layout of the image display window (ImageDisplayCtrl) to
	  save space and leave more room for the image.

	* Added image rotation to the ImageProcessor class and the user interface,
	  removed flipXY. (Currently the graphics classes only transform figures 
	  correctly for angles like +-90 or +=180 deg. I'm still working on a
	  fix. One fundamental question is whether to transform graphics at all,
	  or just to redraw them from scratch using world (or other) coordinates.

2000-02-08  Version 0.10 

	* Updated the FITS code to use the latest FITS library version
	  from Thomas McGlynn. The new library supports image tiles, so
	  that you don't have to read the entire image into memory. This
	  improves performance for large images, especially files with
	  image extensions.  Performance is better for short images
	  (BITPIX=16) than for floating point though.

	* Implemented incremental image loading for files and URLs. For
	  URLs, you can see the download progress. For files, you may also
	  see the individual image tiles being displayed, depending on the
	  performance.

	* Added a toolbar to the image window with buttons for going back
	  and forth between images, for opening a new image and for
	  interrupting a download in progress.

	* Added a status bar at the bottom of the main image window to
	  display the download progress for URLs.

	* Added a new class MainImageDisplay that adds features to the
	  ImageDisplay class that are needed by "main" image windows, but
	  not by others, such as the zoom window or pan window.

	* Implemented the CatalogNavigator class, which displays a tree of
	  catalogs and lets you navigate the catalog hierarchy and make
	  querries.  The CatalogNavigator can display XML (astrores DTD)
	  files and HTML.  A subclass of CatalogNavigator called
	  JSkyCatNavigator adds the ability to display images as well.
	  The CatalogNavigator also has a toolbar that lets you go back
	  and forth between catalogs, open a new catalog or interrupt a
	  search or download operation.

1999-12-23  Version 0.9  

	* Fixed a number of bugs in the handling of floating point
	  and byte images.

	* Fixed some bugs in the handling of BZERO, BSCALE, and BLANK.

	* Added RenderingHints argument to ImageOps.rescale(), needed to
	  convert the image to "float" after processing with BZERO and
	  BSCALE (the rescale operator does not do this automatically,
	  which could result in image values being truncated to 0 after
	  applying BZERO and BSCALE).

	* Fixed some problems with the pan window and small images.

	* Changed the XML parser used by the astrores classes to IBM's
	  XML4J 3.0.0EA3, after experiencing problems with the older 
	  Sun XML parser. You can get the IBM XML parser from
	  http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xml4j. Note that the catalog
	  classes are still in the early development stage.
	  
	
1999-12-18  Version 0.8 

	* Added View menu item "Scale Interpolation" to select the
	  interpolation for scaling and zooming the image.

	* Added View menu item "Smooth Scrolling", to enable immediate
	  mode panning.

	* Added RenderingHints argument to ImageOps.scale() and used it to
	  turn off tile caching in the zoom window, which was causing
	  "out of memory" problems.

	* Added getFits method to FITSImage to return the internal Fits
	  object.

	* Replaced the inner "for loop" in the FITS data classes with
	  System.arraycopy(), which should be faster, since it is
	  implemented in native code and doesn't check the array bounds
	  each time through the loop.

	* Changed the colormap names.

1999-12-14  Version 0.7  

	* Added color scaling algorithms (square root, log).

	  Images are now centered when loaded (previously only small
	  images were centered).

	  Implemented support for FITS extensions. Now a window pops
	  displaying a table of FITS HDUs and allows you to choose an
	  image to display (tables not supported yet).
	  A new package was added for this: org.eso.jsky.image.fits.gui.

	  Moved ImageChangeEvent to the org.eso.jsky.image package, since
	  it is needed by some classes there. Also added support for
	  colormap and cut level change events.

	  the ImageProcessor class is no longer dependent on the
	  ImageDisplay class. Instead, the setSourceImage() and
	  autoSetCutLevels() methods now have an extra argument, which
	  specifies the region of interest or visible area of the image.
	  This is needed to avoid having to scan the entire image when
	  automatically setting the cut levels. When you set the source
	  image for the image processor, you need to pass a Rectangle2D
	  argument describing the origin, width, and height of the visible
	  area of the image, (or the area of interest), in the coordinates
	  of the source image.

1999-12-10    

	* Added "Look and Feel" menu and org.eso.jsky.util.LookAndFeelMenu
	  class.

1999-12-09    

	* Added color scaling algorithms for log scale and square root
	  scale and implemented the "Reset" button in the Color popup
	  window.

1999-12-08  version 0.6   

	* Changed the package structure to use org.eso.jsky.* for the ESO
	  JSky related classes (instead of just jsky.*).
	
	  Added color handling. Now you can select colormaps and intensity
	  tables and manipulate the colormap with the colorbar. (Only
	  linear scaling is implemented in this version.)

	  Replaced the ImageStatistics operator with two new ones: MinMax
	  gets the min and max pixel values, ignoring bad pixels.
	  CutLevel tries to find the best cut levels for the visible area
	  of the image.

	  Makefile changes: All of the makefiles changed. Each makefile
	  now defines the $(TOP) variable, so that it doesn't need to be
	  defined in master.mk. This makes it more likely that the
	  master.mk include file will not need to be edited at all
	  (if the default classpath is OK).

	  Now using JAI-1.0.1, which is installed into the JDK1.2.x dir,
	  so it no longer needs to be in the classpath.

	  Added support for world coordinates and conversion between pixel
	  and world coordinates (Thanks to Jeremy Jones
	  <Jeremy.E.Jones@gsfc.nasa.gov> for providing the Java port of
	  Doug Mink's wcssubs package).
	   
	  Added support for 3 and 4 dimensional FITS images, where the 3rd
	  and 4th dimensions are of size 1 (Thanks to Jeremey Jones for
	  the fix).

	  Did some performace tuning.

1999-11-23  version 0.4   

	* Fixed a number of bugs and optimized performance by making sure
	  no unecessary image generation is done. Also added special
	  handling for the pan window image.  Now the FITS codec generates
	  a small preview image on request.  The median-filter code is
	  temporarily disabled in this version, as is the handling of
	  BLANK pixels. It will reappear in a later version.
	    
	  NOTE: The next version will have a different package structure:
	  org.eso.jsky.image, instead of jsky.image, etc...

1999-11-15  version 0.3  

	* Started setting up an ftp repository for JSky. Minor changes in
	  top level Makefile and scripts.

1999-11-15  version 0.2    

	* Fixed a number of bugs dealing with panning and zooming. The
	  previous version had problems with images that were not
	  square. Also fixed the the flipX/Y and rotate methods.

1999-06-03  Version 0.1  

	* Initial version, including basic JAI FITS support, image display
	  widgets (ImageDisplay, ImageDisplayControl), and basic catalog
	  widgets (Catalog, LocalCatalog, TableDisplay).
