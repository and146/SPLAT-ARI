The MIRAGE package provides adaption of mirage format input files to
the Starlink tables infrastructure.  A command-line script 'starmirage' 
is provided which will invoke Mirage given a StarTable by name.

NOTE THAT: the Mirage package itself is not part of this starlink package,
for licencing reasons.  All this mirage stuff will only work if 
the Mirage classes (probably called Mirage0.1.jar) is on your classpath
at run time.  The Mirage home page is at
