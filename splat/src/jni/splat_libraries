#  Set the list of directories we will search for the libraries.
#  If this in ADDLIBS first followed by any directories in 
#  $STARLINK/lib or /star/lib. Decided against LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#  as this contains things like "/usr/lib" which we don't want to pick
#  up any libraries from.

#  Ok, now create the actual list. The main problem is that libraries
#  are identified using the "-l" form, whereas we need the full names
#  to extract the ".o" files. The list also contains a reference to
#  the AST libraries that we need to remove (get these from JNIAST).
