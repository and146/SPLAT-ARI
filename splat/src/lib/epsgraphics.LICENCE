EPS Graphics2D is distributed under the GPL. The support URL is:

  http://www.jibble.org/epsgraphics/

Note 9-MAY-2006. Cannot see the dual licence agreement anymore, so
this could be the last free release. 

Patches: patched the clipping to interchange grestore/gsave in 
EpsGraphics2D.java, stops the graphics context being reset.
