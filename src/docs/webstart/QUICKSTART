  Setting up webstart
  -------------------

Do a fresh checkout.

Build and install ANT.

Decide where you want to serve the system from and define the
necessary webstart.codebase. Here's my ~/.stardev.properties from
Durham:

   star.dir=/loc/pwdc/pdraper/scratch/stardev
   star.archive.dir=/loc/pwdc/pdraper/scratch/stardev/archives
   stardev=/star
   perl=/star/Perl/bin/perl
   webstart.codebase=http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~pdraper/starjavac
   webstart.signer=Peter W. Draper

Build the system and install.

Sign ANT (from source directory):

  % ant sign_ant

make the installation "lib" directory your codebase on your server
(if server follows softlinks that's easy). If your server doesn't
know about the JNLP mime type try adding a .htaccess file:

  % cat ~/public_html/.htaccess
AddType application/x-java-jnlp-file    .jnlp
AddType application/x-java-archive-diff .jardiff


Try to run up an application:

  % javaws http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~pdraper/starjavac/splat.jnlp

Make a web page with all the applications present and some notes about
installing webstart (and what applications are supported on what
OSes).

For more complex uses, see the README (source/src/docs/webstart), build
files or ask me.
