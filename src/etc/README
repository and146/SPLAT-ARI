The files here comprise the release of the Starlink java infrastructure
and applications set.  The files are as follows:

    LICENCE.txt
        - The licence under which this software is to be used.

    starjava.zip
    starjava.tar.gz
        - These are all the required runtime files, consisting of jar 
          class libraries and associated resources etc.  The content of
          the two files is the same, but one is in a zip file and the
          other is in a compressed tar file.
          Native code for the following systems is included:
              i386:   Linux on Intel
              sparc:  Solaris on SPARC
              alpha:  Tru64 Unix on Alpha
              x86:    MS Windows on Intel (some versions)

    starjava-docs.zip
        - A zip archive of the javadoc documentation tree for 
          all the library-level public classes.  It includes all the 
          starlink java libraries plus some of the third party ones 
          used by the Starlink classes.

    starjava-sources.zip
        - A zip of the source files used to compile the starjava
          set.  It includes some third party source files and class 
          libraries.

    starjava-src.zip
        - A zip of just the java source files from the uk.ac.starlink 
          namespace.  While this may not be sufficient to build the
          starjava set correctly it is easier for browsing and may 
          be enough for building some of the packages.

The top level of all the archives (tar/zip files) is the 'starjava'
directory.  All should be unpacked from the same place.
