Tags File
=========

This file provides an informal record of each tag applied to the Starlink
java CVS repository.

r0-1:
   Date:   20-DEC-2002(?)
   Tagger: Mark Taylor
   Info:   Initial tag.

r0-2:
   Date:   11-FEB-2003
   Tagger: Mark Taylor
   Info:   Corresponds to Treeview 2.1.  Certain packages in the repository
           were not tagged at this point since they have broken build/test
           targets: the new packages COCO, PAL, RV are omitted because the
           install targets don't quite work and recent changes related to
           HDX are omitted because they cause some of the test targets to
           fail (FITS, HDS).

r0-3:
   Date:   21-FEB-2003
   Tagger: Mark Taylor
   Info:   Added now non-broken copies of COCO, PAL, RV and fixed JNIAST so
           that you don't now need to copy an external AST source file
           into the source directory.

r0-4:
   Date:   14-MAR-2003
   Tagger: Mark Taylor
   Info:   JNIAST up to V1.8-13, which means the corresponding version of
           AST, or later, needs to be available.
           Treeview test target fails, but treeview once installed works.
           One directory needs to be created during install for sog.

r0-5:
   Date:   29-APR-2003
   Tagger: Mark Taylor
   Info:   JNIAST uses AST2, FROG introduced, TOPCAT available within
           Table package and many other things too no doubt.
           This tag does not include changes in non-HDX packages to match 
           recent HDX updates; its purpose is to serve as a marker for 
           the last, known-working, non-HDX versions of NDX, FITS, HDS etc.
           All tests succeed apart from HDX (and maybe FROG?)
