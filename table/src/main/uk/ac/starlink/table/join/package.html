<body>
Classes for performing table joins by matching rows to each other.
The matching is done in an entirely configurable and pluggable way
by defining a {@link uk.ac.starlink.table.join.MatchEngine} which defines
what counts as a match between two tuples (rows) and can be used to
work out what counts as a near miss too.  Matching is (except in 
pathological cases) an O(N ln N) process,
where N is the total number of rows in all the tables participating in
a match.
<code>MatchEngine</code> implementations are provided for a number of
(astronomically) common cases, including N-dimensional Cartesian, 
spherical polar, exact value and Sky matching 
(the Sky one uses the HEALPix scheme).
You can also combine matches to an arbitrary level of complexity.
