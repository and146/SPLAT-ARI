This set of directories is intended to contain template files for 
the various types of packages. Currently these are just build files
for application, class library and third-party libraries.

Start with these when adding a new package. The least complete
(i.e. most likely to change) is the application build file. This
doesn't support the full range of features (mostly the additional
files that are carried around, like javahelp). 

If you need to add JNI support (but you shouldn't), then check out 
the packages that do this already (SPLAT, JNIAST and JNIHDS).

Also if you don't see a feature in the templates, then look at the
more complete examples in the full packages.
