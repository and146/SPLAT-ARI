<body>
<p>Classes containing static public members designed for use in JEL
expresssions entered by the user at runtime.
The doc comments for the classes in this package are processed by 
custom javadoc doclets (see package <code>uk.ac.starlink.topcat.doc</code>)
to provide parts of the application user document and online help files.
For this reason they may be written in a somewhat non-standard style
(e.g. avoiding technical Java terms and exotic HTML tags).
