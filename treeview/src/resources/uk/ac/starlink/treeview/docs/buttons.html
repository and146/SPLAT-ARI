<body><h2>Buttons</h2>
The following buttons are in the tool bar:
<dl compact>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.EXIT"></img></dt>
<dd>Exits Treeview without further ado</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.LOAD"></img></dt>
<dd>Pops up a file browser which allows you to enter a new file or directory
    into the tree</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.SPLIT_BESIDE"></img></dt>
<dd>Displays the Details panel to the right of the Tree panel (default)</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.SPLIT_BELOW"></img></dt>
<dd>Displays the Details panel below the Tree panel</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.SPLIT_NONE"></img></dt>
<dd>Displays only the Tree panel with no Details panel</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.OPEN"></img></dt>
<dd>Collapses the selected node, so its children are no longer visible<br>
    (same as clicking on the handle of an expanded node)</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.CLOSE"></img></dt>
<dd>Expands the selected node, so its children are no longer visible<br>
    (same as clicking on the handle of a collapsed node)</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.EXCISE"></img></dt>
<dd>Recursively collapses the selected node.<br>
    Its children, and its childrens' children, and their children...
    are all closed.</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.CASCADE"></img></dt>
<dd>Recursively expands the selected node.<br>
    The selected node is expanded, and all its children, and all its 
    childrens' children...  This enables you to see the entire contents
    of a given node.  If performed on a node containing a lot of data,
    e.g. the top of a large directory structure, it may take a long
    time to complete. 

<p></p>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.UP"></img></dt>
<dd>Replaces the selected node with its parent.<br>
    You can walk up the hierarchy tree inserting nodes above the current
    one using this button.  
    It is only available for a node at the top level of the tree.</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.DOWN"></img></dt>
<dd>Copies the selected node to the top level of the tree.<br>
    You can assemble a set of nodes of interest at the same level in 
    the tree using this button and the ones listed above and below.</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.RELOAD"></img></dt>
<dd>Reloads the selected node.<br>
    The selected node is refreshed from its original data, so for instance
    if a directory node is selected this will cause the directory to be 
    re-read so that any new/deleted files are taken account of.
    A reload has the effect of (recursively) collapsing the node in 
    question.</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.DELETE"></img></dt>
<dd>Deletes the selected top-level node from the tree.</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.DEMO"></img></dt>
<dd>Adds a new node to the top of the tree containing various types of 
    test data.  Investigating this node is a good way to find out about
    Treeview's capabilities.</dd>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.HELP"></img></dt>
<dd>Displays Help information in the Details panel.<br>
    This has the side-effect of deselecting any selected node.</dd>
