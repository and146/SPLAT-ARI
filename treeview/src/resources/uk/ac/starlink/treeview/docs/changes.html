  </ul>

<h4><a name="v2.1">Version 2.1-0</a> (10 February 2003)</h4>

Many of the known data nodes can now be created from
a stream of data rather than a file on disk.  This means that 
most node types can be viewed directly by naming them with a URL,
or from compressed files on disk, or within a zip/jar or tar archive.
Combinations are quite possible, so for instance you could view the
data in a  compressed FITS file within a zip file within
a compressed tar file obtained using HTTP without having to do any
explicit retrieval/unpacking.
The main exception to this functionality is HDS/NDF files, which 
need to be on a physical disk to be accessed.

<p>A list of the new features is as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>Nodes except HDS/NDF can be viewed from streams 
      (compressed/in zip or tar archive/over the wire).
  <li>Tar archives now supported.
  <li>Gzip and bzip2 compression supported.
  <li>Nodes report their complete paths.
  </ul>

<h5><a name="v2.1-1">Version 2.1-1</a> (11 February 2003)</h5>

  </ul>
