<h2>Demonstration data</h2>

<p>This node contains nodes of various types which Treeview knows how 
to display.</p>

<p>A good way to find out about Treeview's capabilities is to investigate
this node by expanding it and its descendants.  Do this individually
by clicking on the handle (<img src="IconFactory.HANDLE1"></img>) to
expand a node, or all at once by selecting (clicking on) the 
top-level "Demonstration Data" node and then clicking 
the <img src="IconFactory.CASCADE"></img>&nbsp;button in the toolbar.</p>

<p>For each node that this reveals in the tree, select it and investigate
the corresponding details which are shown in the panel on the right.
Clicking each of the tabs in the in details panel will show a different
aspect of information on the selected node.</p>
