<h2><a name="intro"></a><img src="IconFactory.TREE" alt="Tree">&nbsp;What is Treeview?</h2>
Treeview is a viewer for hierarchical structures, and knows about
a number of astronomical file formats 
(including FITS, HDS/NDF, NDX, VOTable) amongst other things.  
As well as examining files in a directory tree, in most cases it can
work just as well on compressed files, data from a URL, and data in 
(optionally compressed) zip or tar archives.
Operation is very intuitive.

<p>Briefly: a tree structure is shown in one panel of a window,
and its nodes can be expanded or collapsed by clicking with a mouse.
When a node is selected, additional information about it is made
available in the other panel of the window; different information 
about the same selected node can be seen by clicking tabs.
Since a picture is worth a thousand words, here is a screenshot:
<p>
<div align="center">

<li><a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/treeview/shots/v2.1-3/generic.gif">version 2.1-3</a>
</ul>

<p>Treeview is written in Java, so can be run on a variety of platforms.

<h2><a name="features"><img src="IconFactory.TREE" alt="Tree">&nbsp;List of features</h2>

Treeview deals with the following generic forms of node:
<dl>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.ARY2" alt="Array">&nbsp;<b>Arrays:</b>
<dd>
  These are found within FITS SIMPLE/IMAGE HDUs, Starlink HDS/NDF files
  and Starlink NDX structures, and represent an N-dimensional hypercube
  of numbers.  They have the following views:
  <ul>
  <li>1-d arrays (e.g. spectra) can be displayed as a line plot
  <li>2-d arrays can be displayed as an image at 1x magnification;
      this does not require loading the whole image, so can be fast 
      even for large arrays
  <li>The values of the pixels in even very large arrays can be viewed in 
      a scrollable 1-d or 2-d table.  Again, the whole array does not
      need to be loaded, so this is fast
  <li>Higher-dimensional (&gt;2d) arrays can be shown as image slices 
      through the array along any axis
  <li>Three-dimensional arrays can be viewed collapsed 
      (by averaging over some or all planes) along any given axis 
      to give an image
  <li>Statistics (mean, variance etc) of an array can be calculated.
  <li>An external program 
      <a href="http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~pdraper/splat/splat.html">SPLAT</a>
      can be launched for detailed analysis of 1-d spectral data
  <li>An external program
      SoG 
      can be launched for detailed analysis of 2-d image data
  </ul>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.TABLE" alt="Table">&nbsp;<b>Tables:</b>
<dd>These are found in TABLE/BINTABLE FITS extensions, or in VOTable files.
    They have the following views:
  <ul>
  <li>Table data is shown in a compact scrollable table.
  <li>Table has full JTable functionality - columns can be moved around, 
      width altered etc.
  <li>All available column and table metadata can be displayed in a 
      tabular format
  <li>An external program
      <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>
      can be launched for detailed examination of the table
  </ul>


</dl>
Treeview understands the structure of the following kinds of nodes and

  </ul>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.NDF" alt="NDF">&nbsp;<b>Starlink NDF files:</b>
<dd>
  <ul>
  <li>All array views described above are supported.
  <li>Magic bad values are treated properly.
  <li>The co-ordinate Frames can be viewed in several formats 
      (native, XML and a variety of FITS encodings)
  <li>The extent of a 2-d array in any of its WCS co-ordinate Frames 
      can be displayed, with a grid plotted.
  <li>NDF HISTORY components are shown
  </ul>

<dt><img src="IconFactory.STRUCTURE" alt="HDS">&nbsp;<b>Starlink HDS container files:</b>
<dd>
  <ul>
  <li>The structure of arbitrarily complicated HDS files can be seen.
  <li>All array views described above are supported for array components.
  </ul>

<dt><a name="node.votable"></a><img src="IconFactory.VOTABLE" alt="VOTable">&nbsp;<b>VOTable files:</b>
<dd>

<dd>
  <ul>
  <li>Zip (PKZIP-like) and Jar archives displayed like directory structures
  <li>Many node types within archive can be viewed as if they were normal files

</ul>

The items in this list refer to the latest version.

<hr>
<h2><a name="obtain"><img src="IconFactory.TREE" alt="Tree">&nbsp;How to obtain it</h2>


If you are at a Starlink site, a not-very-recent version of 
Treeview should be installed as part 
of the standard Starlink distribution; it can probably be invoked
by typing
<pre>
   /star/bin/treeview <i>name</i>
</pre>
or just 
<pre>
   treeview <i>name</i>
</pre>
at the shell prompt.

<p>If you are not at a Starlink site, or if you are but want to use some 
of the <a href="changes.html">newer features</a> you can 
download the latest copy from the
<a href="ftp://andromeda.star.bris.ac.uk/pub/star/starjava/">anonymous ftp 
site</a>, which contains source code and javadocs as well as the
runtime jar files etc.
Full installation instructions are given in the:
<blockquote>
<a href="install.html">Installation guide</a>.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2><a name="versions"></a><img src="IconFactory.TREE" alt="Tree">&nbsp;Available versions</h2>
Treeview is still undergoing development, 
as are some aspects of the way that Starlink distributes software, 
so there is an interesting range of versions available.
<ul>
<li><b>Version 1.1</b> appeared on the Starlink Spring 2002 CD-ROM.
    This is the most recently published Starlink distribution, 
    and so is the version likely to be installed at Starlink sites.
<li><b>Version 1.4</b> apppeared on the Winter 2002 Starlink CD-ROM.
<li><b>Version 2.1-3</b> appears on the Summer 2003 Starlink CD-ROM.
<li><b>Version 2.2-1</b> appears on the Spring 2004 Starlink release.
<li>More up to date versions are available from 
    this web page (see <a href="install.html">installation guide</a>); 
    the idea is that updates can be made frequently 
    and downloaded without having to wait for the next CD to be released.
</ul>
Details of Starlink releases can be found on the 
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/Download/">Starlink Download</a> page.
<p>For details of which features appear in which versions, see
the <a href="changes.html">version history</a>.

<h2><a name="next"><img src="IconFactory.TREE" alt="Tree">&nbsp;What's next?</h2>

There is a long list of new features and enhancements I would like to
make to Treeview.  The following is a list in very roughly the order 
in which they might get done.  Some are small additions, some are 
major projects.  Items get added about as fast as
they get taken off, so ones near the bottom of the list may well 
never reach the top.
<ul>
<li>Viewing of FTP/GridFTP directories
<li>Allow SPLAT/SoG invocation for all arrays (not just NDX/NDF nodes)
<li>Tooltip balloons for tabs in detail panel
<li>Improved spectrum coordinate display (using AST V2)
<li>WCS 'grid' panel for 1-d arrays
<li>Zoom in/out for image display
<li>GSD (Global Section Datafile) file support (pure java or JNI?)
<li>Splash screen on startup

<li>HTML file support
<li>Graphics file support (gif jpeg etc)
<li>Proper handling of NDF AXIS information
<li>FITS-like display of NDF MORE.FITS extension
<li>Support for Astrores tables
<li>Use of WCS in &gt;2-d arrays
<li>Allow detaching of tabbed detail panel
<li>Glob data node
<li>Restructure for user extensibility, so custom node types can be 
    added dynamically
<li>AIPS++ table support (pure java or JNI or CORBA?)
<li>Better memory management (there are leaks)
<li>One-click demo mode
<li>Invocation of non-Java/web-services programs (GAIA)
