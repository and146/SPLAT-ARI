<h1><img src="IconFactory.TREE_LOGO">&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing Treeview</h1>

<h2><img src="IconFactory.TREE">&nbsp;Requisites</h2>

<p>Treeview is written in java using J2SE1.4.

It makes use of some optional components (JAI, JNIAST and JNIHDS),
which are installed separately; however if these are absent the program
will run quite happily with the corresponding facilities disabled.

<p>Since the core program is written in pure java, it will run anywhere
that a Java 1.4 virtual machine is installed, and this means it can
run on a wide range of platforms.  It has been tested on Linux, 
Solaris, Compaq Tru64 Unix and MS Windows.  Note however that there
are currently problems with some of the optional components in 
Tru64.

<p>The following procedure describes how to install the Starlink 
java classes from scratch.  
This gets you Treeview plus some other applications
(<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/splat/">SPLAT</a>,
 <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>,
 <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/sog/">SoG</a>,
 <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/frog/">FROG</a>)
and utilities (NDTools), 
along with all the Starlink java infrastructure classes
and a number of third party class libraries required by them, as
well as the Java Runtime Environment itself.
All these are documented elsewhere.
Not all of this infrastructures is used by Treeview, but it is 
currently distributed together for ease of installation and maintenance.

<h2><img src="IconFactory.TREE">&nbsp;Installation procedure</h2>

<p>Follow these steps:
<h3>1.  Install version 1.4 of the Java Runtime Environment if you do not
    already have it.</h3>

    If you already have java installed, find out what version it is;
    something like "<tt>java -version</tt>" will probably tell you this.
    If the version is lower than 1.4.0, you will need to replace this
    version or install a separate one for Treeview to use
    (NB at least one of the beta releases, version 1.4.0-beta3, is known
    <em>not</em> to work, so you probably need a proper release).
 
    <p>You can get versions for Linux, Solaris/SPARC, Solaris/x86 and
    MS Windows from 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html">Sun's web site</a>
    (you only need the JRE download rather than the SDK, 
    unless you will be doing development work).  MS Windows users can use Sun's 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/download.html">automatic download</a>
    procedure if they prefer.
    J2SE Runtime Enviroments (sometimes called JVM or Java Virtual Machines)
    for other platforms may be available from operating system vendors;
    Sun maintains a <a href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi">list
    of java implementations for other platforms</a>; make sure you get
    version 1.4.0 or higher.

<h3>2.  Install Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) <i>(Optional)</i></h3>

    JAI is used for graphical display of arrays; without this you will
    not be able to see image-type display of data files.
    <p>Download this package from the <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/downloads/download-1_1_1_01.html">Sun download site</a>.
    Unless you are doing development, you will want to use the
    "JRE install" option (note the CLASSPATH install will <i>not</i> work
    without some changes, because of the way that Treeview does its 
    class loading).
    <p>Although Sun only advertises versions for Solaris, Linux and MS Windows,
    it is possible to use these on other platforms; if you have a different
    platform download, say the Linux one and install it anyway.
    This should provide the necessary imaging functionality, 
    but without some platform-speicific graphical acceleration.
    You may also see some complaints at runtime about missing components.
    

<h3>3.  Install the Starlink Java classes</h3>
    Download the Starlink java set as a 
    <a href="ftp://andromeda.star.bris.ac.uk/pub/star/starjava/starjava.zip">zip archive</a> or 
    <a href="ftp://andromeda.star.bris.ac.uk/pub/star/starjava/starjava.tar.gz">compressed tar archive</a>
    (Unix users should use the tar archive since it gets the permissions right)
    and unpack it somewhere suitable.
    This contains not only the jar files which contain the classes,
    but various scripts and other platform-independent 
    run-time files which may be useful.

    <p>Some platform-dependent files (native libraries) are also included.
    They are currently installed for the following platforms:
    <ul>
    <li>Linux RH9 compatible (i386)</li>
    <li>Solaris (sparc)</li>
    <li>Win32 (x86)</li>
    <li>Mac OS X (ppc)</li>
    </ul>
    If you do not have one of these platforms, some of the facilities may
    be unavailable; these are generally those provided by the JNIAST 
    (coordinate manipulation) and JNIHDS (Starlink HDS/NDF file format access)
    packages.  If you need these for a platform which is not listed above,
    contact Starlink to enquire about availability.


<h2><img src="IconFactory.TREE">&nbsp;Away you go</h2>

<p>The package is now installed. 
<p>To invoke the Treeview tool on Unix you should now put the 
"<tt>bin</tt>" directory (which contains the "<tt>java</tt>" command) 
from the JRE which 
you installed at step (1) on your path,
and you can then use the script
<pre>
    starjava/bin/treeview [file ...]
</pre>
under where you unpacked the starlink
classes in step (3) to invoke Treeview.

<p>If this doesn't work (and on non-Unix operating systems it may well not do)
then change directory to the <tt>starjava/lib/treeview</tt> directory
and invoke Treeview by doing
<pre>
   java -jar treeview.jar [file ...]
</pre>
You may also be able to invoke this jar file directly, for instance
by clicking on it in Windows.
