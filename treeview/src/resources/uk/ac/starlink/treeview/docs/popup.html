<h2>Popup "Alter-ego" menus</h2>

<p>For most of the nodes displayed in the tree you can obtain a 
popup "alter-ego" menu.  How you do this is platform-dependent,
but you will typically click with the right mouse button 
on the name of the node.

<p>Here is an example of the menu you might get from a Starlink NDF file:
<div>
<img src="popup.gif"></img>
</div>
The top line says 'Reload' and shows the same icon that the node
already has (indicating an NDF structure).  If you pick this option,
Treeview will reload the file as an NDF; the purpose of this is so
that you can update the state of a node in the tree if the file
it represents has changed since it was first reveealed.
Reloading a node which represents a directory in this way will
refresh it with the files in the directory at the time the reload is done.

<p>The other lines give different icons and different kinds of 
nodes which it can be viewed as.  An NDF can be seen as an HDS 
structure, or as a Starlink NDX structure, or simply as a normal
plain file in the directory structure.  So if you pick the bottom
line on the menu, the NDF icon will disappear from the tree to
be replaced by a plain icon representing a file, and you will only
be able to see its size and last modified date.  You can popup
a menu on this node in turn and change it back into an NDF or 
into one of the other selections you are given.
