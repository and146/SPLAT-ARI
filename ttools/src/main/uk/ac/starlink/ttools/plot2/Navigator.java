     * for modified or non-button-1 clicks.

     * a data position from a screen position,
     * which is not always trivial, for instance in a 3D plot one
     * graphics position maps to a line of data positions.
     * The <code>dposIt</code> argument can optionally
     * be supplied to cope with such instances.  If a data pos cannot be
     * determined, null is returned.  If <code>dposIt</code> is absent,
     * the method will run quickly.  If it's present, the method may or may
     * not run slowly by iterating over the data points.
