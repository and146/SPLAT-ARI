/**
 * An efficiently stored RGB or RGBA image backed by an int buffer.
 * Each pixel is represented by a 4-byte int, with the three least-significant
 * bytes giving 0-255 levels of red, green, blue (msb-&gt;lsb) 
 * and, optionally, the most significant byte giving alpha.
 * This corresponds to the {@link java.awt.image.BufferedImage} constants
 * <code>TYPE_INT_RGB</code> and <code>TYPE_INT_ARGB</code>.
 * The values in the buffer are therefore the same as those used by
 * <code>BufferedImage</code> <code>setRGB</code>/<code>getRGB</code>,
 * but can (presumably) be manipulated more efficiently by addressing the
 * array here directly.
 * These RGB values are also the same as those used by {@link Compositor}.
