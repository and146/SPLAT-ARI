Classes providing custom serialization/deserialization of StarTables
in JAX-RPC SOAP calls.
StarTables are serialized as VOTABLE elements containing the 
bulk data as a BINARY inline stream element, since this will be the
most space-efficient way of doing it.

<p>The appropriate parameter type is given by
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.soap.VOTableSerialization#QNAME_VOTABLE}.

<p>Although in principle these should work with any JAX-RPC implementation,
in practice there are several places where the code has had to be
made AXIS-specific, so it's unlikely they will work with
implementations other than AXIS.
