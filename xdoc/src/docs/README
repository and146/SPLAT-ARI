XDOC is a package containing classes and other files (e.g. XSLT stylesheets)
used at build time for constructing documentation (mostly XML-based).
It is not intended for use except at build time, so need not be distributed
in pre-built versions of the software.

At time of writing (20 Feb 2006) the files here are a post-hoc collection
of items which formed parts of build systems not in the starjava 
repository.  Having been knocked together for essentially private use,
the standard of documentation of this pacakge itself may not be very high.
Sorry.
