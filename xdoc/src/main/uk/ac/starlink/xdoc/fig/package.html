Utility classes to help with drawing figures.
{@link uk.ac.starlink.xdoc.fig.FigureIcon} can be subclassed to do the 
actual drawing, and methods it provides can be used to view the figure
as a Swing window or to export it to EPS.  The other classes here are
utilities for doing things that you might want to do in a figure.

<p>At time of writing, this is work in progress.
